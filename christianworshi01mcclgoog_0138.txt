concerned, it was only necessary to nota the anthemo,
which gave tha tona lor the psalm, saeing thet the
choristars either had a psalter in their hands, or else
knew tha psalm eo thoroughly by heart that it was
naedless to inscribe it in the antiphonary.

Antiphonal chanting of the psalma as it obtains today
is executed sometimes with a rapid, and at others with a
slow, movement and more complicated modulations. Tha
latter method is almost exclusively reserved for the antiphon
of the introit, while the other ia of general use in tha
psalmody of the office. Itis probable that at the beginning
the slow movement was that which was more generally
followed. There has been a progressive shortcning of all
the parts of Divine Servioe, whether prayers, lectione,
or chants, bnt it was in the category of the chants that
most of the suppressions ocouned. We see this clearly in
the antiphone of the Mass. Inone of these-the introit-
the psalm is reduced to a single verse, followed by the
doxology‚ while in the antiphon ad communicarat it has
entirely disappeared.

ln addition ιο tha psalma introduced between the
lectione and the antiphons of the Roman Mass, the
Eucharistio service admitted other chants, of which l
will treet later on. All os them, with tha exception of
the Sonat-ua, are of relatively recent date. In regard to
the saratas, moreover‚ it is necessary to distinguish
between its words and the musical rendering of them.
The present oustom of reciting the seraphia hymn in
common, and cloud, goes back ιο the same early date aa
that assigned to the general subject-matter of the presace
and of the canon. The application of melody ιο the words
is probably of later date.

I do not include under the term liturgical ohant the
recitative or intoning of the lectione or such of the prayers
