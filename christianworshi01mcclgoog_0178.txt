Sootland‚ hut now in the University Library at Cem-

and (3) in e manuscript et st. Gali* The material in
these is, however, very scanty.

We possess, on the other hand, an Irish liturgicel book,
entirely frea from any trees of Roman influente. This is
the Antiphonary of sanger! This manuscript, now pre·
served in the Ambrosian mbmry, is dated by the list which
terminatos it. This gives the names oi the abbots of the
monastery of Bangor⁶ from Oomgill, its founder, down to
Crouan, the abbot then living, whose rule extended from
680 to 691. The manuscript also contains a number of
hymns for the office of Matius, various prayers con-
nected with the same office, and a few antiphons and

other small pisces.
