be distinguishable from subdeaoous, but above it, and over
the shouldar. The Oouneil of Toledo, in 633, defined (e. 27)
the mariam as a distinguishing mark, eommon to tha
three major orders, bishops, priests, and deaoons. It speoified
(o. 39) that the deaoon should wear it over his left
shoulder, and that it should be white, without admixtum
of colours or gold ambroidery. Another Couneil of
Braga, held in 675, forbade priests (o. 3) to releba-ate
Mass without having au orariam passed round the neelr

of episcopal aud also of diaooual insignia; he gives to the

tho neck, that it falls over the breast, and is terminated

a stole (stola), aud says that the deaoon wears it over
the albo. This fashion of wearing the diaoonal stole
spread, during the Middle riges, over nearly tho whole
of Italy, and even to tho gates of Rome.¹ In Rome

The presbyter’s stole was also adopted, and in the
mosaios of Senta Maria in Trastevere (twelfth oentury)
we see a priest wearing that vestment. Itis to be noted
that the four Popes who appear {in the same mosaic are

wearing the palliam, but not tho stole. The oue seems to
exclude the other. In fact, the Ordines of the ninth
century, when deseribing the dress of the Pope, always
omit the stole. On those monuments, moreovor, where both
