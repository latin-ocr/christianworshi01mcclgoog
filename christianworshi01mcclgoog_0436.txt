of prayers assigned to the officiating minister until the
Creator ct abactam, whose frequent repetitions are in
the Gallicau styla; and thirdly, that it omits altogether
the two consecrating prayers, Daca qai loca and Deos saoc-

these prayers were foreign to the original Gallican ritual.
The eliminatiou of them, however, does notin any way

prayer, Deua manipotcaa, io cujas terimam, is transferred,
itis true to tha end, but this serves to give only more
unity to the ritual‚ for in place of two consecrating
prayers we have only ona.

Aa for the remaining portion, we find it touched upon

where the dedication of an oratory in honour of St. Allyre

ceremony in his cathedral town. On the previous night
the relies had been “watched'' in the basiliae oi St.
Martia. Tha bishop proceeded in the morning to the
oratory, where ha consecrated the altar.2 He then returned
to the basilica, aud, having taken the relies, translated
them in processioa to the oratory. The ceremonias
assume here the same order as those in our seoond
ritual. At Rome the eeremony would have begun by
the fetohing of the relics from the basilica where they
had been provisionally placed.

A most remarkable coincidence is found between

the ceremony described and the Byzantina ritual pub-
lished by Goar.³ In this ritual the dedication and the
