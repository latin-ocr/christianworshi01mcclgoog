242 CHRISTIAN woasme: lus ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Of the stadrayeeima (Τεσσαρακοστῆ, Lent) no traces
are found before the fourth century.¹ The fifth canon
of the Council of Nicaea (325) contains the earliest
mention of it. From this time forvvard it is frequently
referred to, but at first chiefly as a time of preparation
for baptism, or for the absolutiones penitents, or as a
seasou of retreat and recollection for the faithful living
in the world. Among the duties of these sacred weeks
footing naturally occupied an important place, but the
practice varied in different countries. In the “festal
letters '' of St. Athanasius² we are able to follow the prognaes

of the observance of Lent iu Egypt. St. Athanasius speaks,
in the beginning, of the 111111 01 Lent and of the aaa of

ι01130111110111111011 Lukc x., which is sometimes cited as an earlier
witness, existe only iu the revised Latin text of Rufinus. and cannot there·
fore be regarded as evidence of a custom contemporary with the great
doctor of Alexandria. What it says of the fast of forty days is manifestly
in contradiction with the sequence of ideas in this fragment.

¹ See especially those of the years 320, 330, 340, 341. 317. 111 1110 11111
(339)11 11 merely dealt with as a preparation ior the festival of Easter,
sud that, too, in s general way without any mention of the Quadragesims:
the fast is indicated in the iudex as commencing ou the blonday in
Holy Week. In 3301110 Quadragesimal period is mentioued as lastiug
for six weeks, but the fast, strictly speaking, is always that of Holy Week.
It was well understood thst fastiug was among the number of uecemary
exercises preparatory to the observares of Foster: it was not, however,
prescribed as of strict obligatior, 01 as a custom accepted everywhere. The
Egyptians maintained, for the most part, only the fest of Holy Week. While
St. Athanasius was at Rome iu 840 and the following years, he was the
subject of reproaelr in respectui this practice. He complains of this in a
note appended ta his fastai letter oi 341. It was dated at Rome, and
addressed to his friend Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis, who was charged with
the supervision of the Ghurches of Egypt iu his 1111111100. He exhorta him
iu impressius terme to enjoiu upon the Egyptians the observares of the
fast, saying that they maire themselves the laughingstoclr of the world.
Eram this time forward the index mentions regularly the fast of the
Forty Dsys aud of 11on Weelr. Praviously §nathanain spolie of them
as the time oi Laut and the weelr of the fast. Iu the festal letter of
847 it is formassy declarsd that he “who shall neglect the observares
of Lent shall not eelebrate Easter,'‘ or, iu other words, shall be excom-

municated for s time.
