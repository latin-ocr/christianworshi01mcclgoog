The “Mass cf the Presanetified'' is not marked by
any greater prominence. It is merely the Communion,
separated from the liturgical celebration of the Eucharist
properly sc called. The details cf the ceremony are not
found earlier than in' books cf the eighth or ninth century,
but the service must belong to a much earlier period. At
the time when Synaxes without liturgy were frequent, the

“Maes of the Presanctified” must have been frequent
also.

In the Greek Church it was celebrated every day in

altar; the Pater noster, with its introductcry and concluding

formularies, was said; a particle of the consecrated breed
was placed in a chalice containing ordinary wine, and
everybody communicated by partaking of the consecrated
bread in the capro and of the wine sanctified as described.
It is probable that the faithful, when they administered
the communion to themselves in their housee, observeda
similar ceremonial.8

Gallioan influencc.
