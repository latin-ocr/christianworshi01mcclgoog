Chnstianity, to the Churoh of J erusulem, the first in point of
time of all Christian Ohurehes, and the most favourably
placed in those early days to serve aa a model. From
this period the question under discussion loses mueh of its
interest Itis one, moreover, somewhat diffioult to treet
with any degree oi precision, owing ιο the psuoity of the
information we possess with regard to the organisation of the
Jewish communities of the Dispersion. The eondition of these
differed widely. In some instantes, where the J ewish popu·
lation was oonsidereble, several synagogues were to be found
in ona and the same town, although the Hebrew eommunity
es a whole was under a single ruler. This was the oeae at
Alexandria where the Jews were under the dimotion ol their
Ethoorclt. At Smyrna, an inscription¹ mentions “ the nation
of tha J ews ; '' but it does not state whether there also they hed
un sthnuroh or some similar magistrate. Ii from the organi·
sation of communities regarded as national bodies we pass
to thet oi the synagogues, which in many enses must have
sarved both purposes, tha information is still more uncertain.
'l'he Gospels end the Aets of the Apostles frequently make
mention of the rulers of the synogogue3 but the information
isrsrely definite enough to enable us ιο determino whether
eaoh synagogae had one or several rulers. When they do
exeeptionully give us the disfinot information we require, it
is not of suah a characteres to enable us to infer the exist-
enee of a single and universelly reeognised type. In the
districtos Gelilee‚ where the raisiug of J ainus’s daughter took

plaoe, there were several “rulers of the synagogue.”⁹ In
the looality where the woman with the spirit of infirmity

was heeled⁰ there was only one. Tha same wantos uniformity
