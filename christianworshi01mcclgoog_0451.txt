All these rites are still found in modern uses. The
nuptial ceremony at the present time comprisee the cere·
monies of the betrothal, as well as those of marriage properly
so called. It begins by the declaration of consent, which,
as the marriage follows immediately after, has here the
character of an engagement dc promenti. The connecting
parties, interrogated by the priest, publicly express their
intention of being united in marriage.¹ Thon follows the
subarrhatio, performed by the bridegroom, with a ring
previously blessed, followed, in many places, by the con·
veyance of the dowry, represented by a medal or piece
of money.

the betrothal, which formerly took place in the family
circle, and without the intervention of the priest. As

and that of the ninth century both agree with that

idea of the nature of the religione marriage, and has giren riso to the belief
that the matrimonial tie depende on the authority of the priest. The
