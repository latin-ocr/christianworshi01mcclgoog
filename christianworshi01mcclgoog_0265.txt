from the observance of fasting. The fast in both places,

therefore, lasted in reality only thirty-six days. There
were, moreover, Ghurches in which, up to the fifth
century, Ient consisted of only three weeks of festmg.
These, whether broken up by intervals or not, always
occurred in the sacred period of six or seven weeks.¹
About the middle of the fifth century the greater number
of divergences had disappeared; the two useges oi Rome-
Alexendria and AntiochOonstentincpls hed absorbed all
others into their respective demaine, end taken definite
shepes.

Certain supplemental days came, however, to be added.
lhe thirty-six days of actual fasting seemed at first to
form a perfect number, that of the tenth of the whole
year.2 The inconsistency of this period with the name
of Quadregesima, however, came to be noted. The author
at Rome of the Liber Poetificclae aought to enforce, even
in his time, the necessity of a seventh week, which
would, according to the Roman usage, have increased
the number of fasting-days to fortytwo. In the seventh
century⁸ four days were added, by what Pope we cannot
say, end from that time forward these have been universally
accepted throughout the West. It was about this time
also that the stational Messes for the three Sundays ie
Septueycaimo, ic Sevoycaa'mo, and ie Quieqeoycaimc, were

¹ Socratas, H. E, v. 22 ; Sczomen, Η. E, vii. 19. Socrates cannot
explain how, while some fest lor thirty-six days, and others for fifteen,
averybody should speak of Quadragsaima. He did not know that the
period cl forty days had bean at first introduced for another purpose than
that of feeling, and thet it was only by a sort of continuone expansion
that the fast succeeded in extending itaeli over the whole Quadrageaima.
