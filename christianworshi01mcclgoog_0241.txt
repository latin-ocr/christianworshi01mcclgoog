220 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS omem AND lcvow'rlorv.

In Ireland the Host was divided in seven different
manners, according to the festivals;¹ at ordinary Messes
into five particles, on the festivals of saints (confessore) and
virgins into seven, on the festivals of martyra into eight,
on Sundays into nine, on the festivals of the Apostles into
slevcn, on the kalcnds of January and on Thursday in
Holy Week into twelvc‚ on the Sunday after Easter and on
Ascension Day into thirteen, and on the festivals of the
Nativity, Ecstor, and Pentecost, into sixty-five. They were
arranged in the form of a crosa, with certain additional
complications when they were numerous. At the com·
munion each of the parts of the cross, crof its additions,
was distributed to a special group of persons, thetis, priests,
monks, etc.

During this ceremony the choir chantcd an antiphon,
which was called in the Ambrosian Liturgy the Ooo-
sraetorc'ccs. A chant of this character is implied in thc
Mozarabic Iiturgy, but in the books now in use it is

replaced by the recitation of the Creed. The following text
occurs only in the Stowe Missal; and it is to be noted that
it is not an antiphon, but a respond.

Fiat, Domina, misericordia tua super nos quamadmodum movimus
in to.

coguoverunt Dominum, alleluia, in fractione panis, alleluia.

Panis quern frangimus corpus sat domini nostri J asu Christi, alleluia.

Calin quem benedicimus, alleluia, sanguis est domini nostri Jcsu Christi,
alleluia, in remissionem peccatorum nostrorum, alleluia.

Fiat, Domim misericordia tua supernos, alleluia, quemadmodum
sperarimm in te, alleluia.

cognoverunt Dominum, alleluia.

populo, quasi unicuique pro merito, aoros oculos, monus ao diversa siugulis
membra distribui?” ’
