the Sacramentary other allusione which may be explained
far more satisfactorily by attributing them to the anxiety
felt during the siege of 537-538 than to any other occaaicns.
Thus we find, for example, in the Reface of another Mass
in the month of July (xviii. 6), the following words :—
Agnoscimus Domine . . . adprobantium meritc perticere ut
ancoram ccccm labora qimesim aab mecla nostro monilm
diripiantur aliems ct quac desudantibus jornalia casei tribuis,
ab hostibus potioris absumi. In the year 537 it was the
Goths who reaped the harvest on the Roman campagus,
and from the tops of the city walls the Romam must have
watched with sorrow the operation by which the fruit of
their own labour passed into the hands of the besiegers.
Itis for other reasons quite impossible to assign this prayer
to the time of Alaric end Geneeric. It was the city rather
than the campagus that suffered from the pillaging of the
Visigoths and the Vandals. Had it referred to them, we
should certainly find somewhere in that long list of Messes

tempora lwstili, some allusione to the sack of public buildings,
charchas, and private houses. When these invaders, more-

over, appeared before the welle of Rome, the season was
too far advanoed for the harvesting to be still proceeding.
On the other hand, everything can be satisfactorily explained
by the hypothesis that it refers to the Ostrogoths and
the siege of 537-538. On the other hand, however, as the
Romans were often besieged during the wars with the
Goths, and later on during the Lombardic invasion, I
would not like to affirm that it was this particular siege by
Vitiges that was actually in question. The latter is the
earliest to which we can assign it, and Ι do not presa the
point further.

The earliest limit having been thus determined, it
remains to be seen whether a more definite one can be
found for the latest date than that furnished by palaeography.

ldo not think that we need look later than the time of
