by sending their own books and recommending their own
use In this manner, little by little, the influeuce cf the
Roman ritual made itself felt. l'he result was at first the
combination of the two uses3 then by degrees the Roman

ended by almost completely eliminating the Gallican. The
following are the main facts cf the history of this change.

In 538, Profuturus, Bishop cf Braga, the metropolitan of
the Suevic kingd0m¹ of Galieia, wrote to Pope Vigilius to
consult him on certain liturgical points. We still possess
the Pope's² reply. Added to this reply were certain
appendices containing decisicns on matters cf discipline,
and, in the way of liturgical texts, the order of the
baptismal ceremonies and of the Roman Mass. The latter
contained merely what we call the Ordinary of the Mass,
that is, the part which does not vary, but the Pope
notified to the Bishop cf Braga that it was customary to
add to it in various places formularies peculiar to the
solemnity of the day. Of these formularies, which repre-

own Sacramentary for himself, in case he thought proper

with the greatest respect. This was manifested a little later
on, when, after the conversion cf the king of the Suevi
