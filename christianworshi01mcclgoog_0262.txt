As for Lent, it has been the subject of many vicissitudes

us well in the matter of its duration as in the rigour with
· which it was observed. lt is certain that the fast before
Bastar, in the time oi Irenaeus, was ior a very short period3
some fasted only for a dsy, others for two, and others again
for a number ol days. Some, moreover, ate nothing ior
forty hours. These periods must be considered, Ι think,
es continuone and uninterrupted fests.l Tertullian was
unacquainted with any solemn fast, presoribed hy the
Catholic Church, except that of the day of the Pascha, a
term which he uses in u special sense here for Good Friday.
He declares that the time of footing included only the
days quibes ablatus estsporrsus, thetis to say, from Good
Friday to Esster Sunday morning.² In Alexandria it was
customary about the middle of the third century to fast
the whole week before Easter Day, some continuously,
and others st intervals. The letter cf St. Dionysius of
Alexandria to Basilides,l in which this question crops up,
is the most ancient authority which we possess for the
observance of Holy Wsek, or the week of Xerophegy.
Before that time the Montanists observed a fast of two
weeks’ duration instead of one, and this custom was con·
tinued amongst them until the fisth century, when their
boasted fest of longer duration than that of others was

surpassed.⁴

prevailing in his own time, misconstrued the and of this text.
