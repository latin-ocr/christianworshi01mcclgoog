the East were in need of an increase of population to
eueura their prosperity. Since the time of the Erile the
J ewe hed greatly increased in numbers, and colonists could
readily be obtained from amongst them. Several dynastiae of
Asiatic rulers-Assyriam, Babyloniane, Medae, and Pereiane
-had already had demonstration of the tractable natura of
the Israeliten, of their disinalinetien te play any part in
politice, and of their resigned and passive loyalty to their
conquerere. No eoveraign could wish to have more faithful
subjecte provided he was careful that their religione customs
should not be interfered with. This was of vital importunae.
The Jews might be brought to live in the midet of Greeks,
to epeak Greek, and even to forget Hehrew; butte convert
them to polythaiem was a thing not tc be thought ef.
Antiochus Epiphanes, who attempted it, could not congratul-
lata himself on the success of hie endeavour. On the other
band, spart from the question of religione assimilabor, it
was impossible to makea Jew into atrae Greek, a cituco
of an Hellenic town. This constituted an obstacle te
colonieatien, but it was surmonnted by arranging that
the Jewieh coloniets should not he introduced among
the body of citizens, hut assigned a privileged position
among those who were non-citizens. They possessed an
entirely separate administrativa and judioial organisation-
a privilege not shared‚ for instance, by tha Syrians of Antioch
or tha Egyptians of Alexandria. anh Jewieh community
rendered obedienta to ite own particular ualere, chosan from
among its membere; it constituted e sort cf subordinate
city, oocupying an intermediata position between the Hellenio
city and the subject populaticn. The religione scruplae of
the Jews were, moreover, respected by law; they could not
he compelled to break the Sabbath, as, for instance, by
appearing in aecurt of justice, and they were exempt from
certain burdans which were repugnant to them, euch ae
military service.
