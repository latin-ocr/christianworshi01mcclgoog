ceremonias given in Dionysius are fundamentally the same,
but thera are soma mors precise details. For instance, tha
deaoon kneels on only one knee during the reciting of
the consecrating prayer. After this prayer, the officiating
minister signs the iorehead of the newly ordained with
the sign of the crosa, and announces solemnly his name.

We see that in all these ritas the ceremony of
ordination consiste especially of a prayer recited over
the candidate in a public and solemn assembly. This
prayer is accompanied by the imposition of hands.¹ In
this general form the ritual is that which we find in the
New Testament? We see, moreover, that the choica of
the rulers and ministare of the (lhurch was from the
beginning reserved to the apostles or to their repre-
sentatives. This authority came naturally to be passed
on to the bishops, their successore and continuans of their
work, as far aa the rule of the local Christian communities
was concerned. Aa for the installation of the bishops
themselves, it was considered indispensable that it should
be antrusted to a more exalted authority than the individual
bishop. This authority could be no other than the superior
jurisdiction of the Ohuroh, that is, the collective episcopal
hierarohy, As it was impossible to bring together st eaoh
ordination all the membors of this hierarohy, it was arranged
that it should be represented by a group of neighbouring
bishops, or, in certain places, by the metropolitan bishop.

¹1t isworth while citing here tha words ol St. Augustino: “Quid
aliud ast manuum impositio qnam oratio super hominem?” 'l'his obser· Ἰ
ration is so trus that the imposition of hands in express terms is frequently
omitted in the books of ritual. It was considered to ba implied in the
oratio saper homiaem. It is neomyalso tc note thatin almost sll tha
known formularies cl prayer the degree to which the candidate is pro-
moted is mentioned 1 say “almost sll,” ior this indication is not found
in the p oyer for the ordination oi apricat in tha Eucholcgion oi Sarapion.
