aa are said aloud. This practice may be very ancient. It was
necessarily introduced assoon as the Christian assemblies
became very large, and thus rendered it difficult for the
officiating minister or reader to make himself hee1d. The
flectione of the voice eerved for ascension of the text,
and thus gave more relies to the intonation. But the
slight modulatione reeulting from this were more ekin to
accentuated reading then to chanting properly so called.

It was for the same reason-namely, the difficulty of
maintaining a high intonation in a large building-that
the custom must have arieen of pronounoing in a low
voice certain formulariee which were evidently intended

in the first instance to be heard by everybody. There
are two of such in the Roman Mass, viz. the prayer
called Serota before the preface, and the Canon from the

Sanctis onwarde. According to the Baetem usage, many
other formidaries of prayer are said in a low voice by
the officiating minister. But in every eounmy these
formularies end in what the Greeks call an ecphonesis
(ἐκφώνησις), thet is, in a raised inflection oi the voice at
the end, so that the congregation may respond with Arnen.
