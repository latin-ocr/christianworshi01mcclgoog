which follows, and which at the beginning was merely the
conclusion of the prayer offered up in silence by the faithful,
was said in a low voice, and hence its name of Sarcta. It
was terminated by an aptacy, that is, by an ending on s
high note, to which Aeaea was responded.

corresponded to the Aaaplcara of the Greek liturgias.¹
It was divided by the chanting of the Scaeas into two
parts of unaqual length, of which the first, sung on
a high note, was called the Paejocc, and the second,
meited in a low tone, named the Caaoa. The Roman
Aaaplrcra possesses testimony to its great antiquity. The
form at present in use existed already, word for word, at
the beginning of the seventh century. St. Gregory gave
to it its final touch, adding to the prayer Haac iys'tar
