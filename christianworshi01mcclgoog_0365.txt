appearance of exorcista and doorkeepers. In the West
the exorcista had somewhat active functione in the
preparatione for baptism, but in the East these iunctione
devolved on other clerics, the exorcists being regarded
rather¹ as persons endowed vvith unusual supernatural
powers received direct from God, and not through the
medium of the Churoh. For this reason, therefore, they
were not included in the ecclesiastica] hierarchy. As to
the doorkeepers, it was not thought euitable to rank among

the elergy persons engaged in so humble an employ-
