ol lower rank, continued the administration ol baptism,
bnt the subsequent ceremonias-the anointing, signing
with the cross, and imposition of hands-were reserved
for the bishop. At Rome, however, and at Alexandria,
doubtless on account of the length ol the service, the
priests first poured the perfumed unguente (holy chriam)
on tho head os the neophyta, thus redueing the Popo's
function to the signing with the erosa and the imposition
ol hands.

When the local Churches became more numerous, and
dependent parishee had been thus created outside the epis·
copel city, it was necessary to cede to the priests of thess
parishes tha right of conferring holy baptism But this
privilege was nowhere extended to them in its entirety.
The blessing of the chriam, and of the oils employed in
baptismal unction in general, was in all places interdicted
to priests, and they were therefore obliged to have recourss
to the bishop to obtain these clemente ready consecrated¹
This restrictior expressed symbolically the idea that none
could enter the Christian community without the personal
intervention ol its supreme ruler.

Baptism with water, which, from the earliest times,
had been considered valid even when conferrcd hy e
Christian layman, was rockened among the officee of a
parish priest The same was the ease with regard to thc
benediction ol fonts, and even, in countries using the
Roman rite, to the anointing with chriam. In these
countries, the signing with the cross only, together with
the layingon of hands, was reserved for the biehop, who

performed these functione either in the episcopal town
or on the occasion ol hie diocesan· visitatione In the
