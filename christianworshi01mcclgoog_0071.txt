50 cnwlsvlsw wesema: [rs ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

On the day 61 the Suu (Sanday) all who live in towns or in the country
gether together 16 oue place, aud the memoirs 61 the apostles or the

writings ot* the propheta are read as long as tirns permits. Thcn when
the render hes oeased, the president verbally instructa aud exhorta to the
imitation oi the good examples cited Thon all ries together, and prsycrs
ere offered. At lengdr, as we have already described, prayer being ended,
bread and wine and water ars brought, and the president offers prayer and

thanhsgivings to dre best 61 his ability, and the people assent by saying
Amen: and the distribution is made to each one 61 his share ol the

elementa which have been blessed, and to those who ure not present it is
sent by the ministry oi tha deacous.

01 the four elementa borrowed from the current usage of
the synagogae—namsly, the lection, the chent, the homily,

and the prayer—tha only ons 61 which there is here no
express mention is the chanting 61 the Psalms. In another

passage 61 his Apouqyfl St. «lustin, in explaining the
ceremonias oi baptism, adds a description oi the eucha-
ristie liturgy in terms similar to those just cited, except
that he hers makes mention 61 the kiss 61 peace, which
the Ο11116116116,116 says, give to one another efter the prayers,
and before beginning the sacred meal, or Eucherist, properly
so called.

St. J nstin confines himself to the description of the order
of service followed 111 the Christian assemblies: 116 gives no
„ ς text, or formulnry of prayer or exhortation. His omissione
on this point, however, can be made good by the help of
‚ very ancient ecclesiastical documents.

·· · 'j The epistle 61 St. clement of Rome preserves for us 6

passage evidently 61 6 liturgioal character. We cannot,
indeed, regard it as 6 reproduction 61 6 sacred formulsry,

but it 16 611 excellent example 61 the style 61 solemn prayer
in which the ecclesiasticsl leaders 61 that time were accus·
tomed to express themselves at meetings for worship.
