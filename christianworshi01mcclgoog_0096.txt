1. tta Eucboloyioa of Sarapion.

Withregard to Christian Egypt, we possessed, until lately‚
no ancient liturgical text which could compare with that
of the Syrien Apostolic constitutions. This want hasbeen
supplied by the discovery, in a manuscript at Mount Athos,
of a collection of prayers, two of which bear the name of
Sarapion, Bishop of Thmuis, a friend and correspondent

of St Athanasius.¹ It is probable that the others are of
the same authorship. The collection comprises thirty com·
positione, connected respectively with the eucharistie liturgy
(1-6), with baptism (7-11), with ordination (12-14), with
the blessing of the oils (15-17), with funereis (18), end with
the office for Sunday (19-30). Itis to the latter that a

sort of final rubrio seems to refer—“All these prayers corne
before that of the Oblation.''

The prayer of the Oblation is the first of the series
referred to, and is an Arauplsoro. The text² is es follows 2—-

ancient autom, this high dignitery is subordinate to the Archbishop ol
Caesares in Cappadocia ; his position is analogous to that of the artanius
oi Seleucia and of the Abuna of the Ethiopians. The united Armenians
here not even the equivalent ot a catholicos, for tho Archbishop os
Leopolis in no wey subordinate to the Patriaroh ol Cilicia. Like him,
he is directly under the Pope. without any intermediary.

¹ 'l'he credit of this· discovery is due to Herr G. Wobbermin, who has
published these texts in the Tecto stud Uolersurbunpen of Goblrardt aud
Hamaelr (new series, vol ii).

friend of St. Athanasius, there should be a kind of predileetion ier
