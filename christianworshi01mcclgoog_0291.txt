270 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ms ORIGIN AND avotomoa.

The Ohurch of Rome seems to have celebrated no

festival of the Virgin before the seventh century, when
it adopted the four Byzantina festivals, of which I will

speak presently.¹

The Gospel² furnishes, in regard to the festival of
St. John Baptista fragment of information which has not
been neglected. The birth of the Forerunner of our Lord
must have preceded that of the Saviour by six months.
I suspect, notwithstanding, that the festival of the 24th
of June was preceded, at least in the Essa by another
commemoration, which was observed about Christmastide.

We have seen what the Nestorian use was in this respect,
end we find that in the Armenian Church also the festival
of the Forenmner of our Lord was the first which was

observed after Epiphany.⁸ The Oalendar of Perpetuus,

Bishop of Tours (461-490), places the Notata S. Jobcaais
between the Epiphany and Oatbadra Patri, that is, exactly

at the same period in the year.⁴
This festival was replaced later on by another, that of

the Persicam Decollatioa of St.J0hn,0bse1-ved on the
teth of August, which was adopted in Gallican regions end
in Constantinople before it was followed at Rome.⁶

snitable for the festival of the Blessed Virgin, bnt that the exigencies of
Lcut and of the paschal festivals did not allow of its adoption.
