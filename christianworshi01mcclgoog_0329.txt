4. Baptista.

The “elect '' were present at the solemn vigil of Easter.
The lections² ohosen for the occasion were meant to present
a summary of the relations between man aud God, and
to form, as it were, a final instruction at the moment of
the accomplishment of the mystery of initiation. Tbese
lectione are practically the same in all the Latin rituale.
Some of the finest passages in the Old Testament are
presented in them-such as the account oi the Greatiou
the Deluge, the Sacrifico of Isaac, the Passage of the Red
Sea, the Vision of Ezekiel, the History of Jonah, the
account of the image set up by Nebuohadnezzar; then
some passages from the propheta, as, for instance, that in
which Isaiah predicte baptism, and extels the vine oi the
Lord; also that dealing with the eovenant of Moses and
the institution of the Paesover. Eaeh one of these lections
is followed by a prayer.⁸ Canticles of a like import are

and that of Adriau, bnt using the text of the former, on account of its better
preservation. As for tha situati hare described that in the Ordines, with
which the Sacramentaryof Adriau is in full agreement. In the Gelasiau
Sacramentary there is found in the ilrst place theprayerDeas incrementorum,
and the consecratory formulary Deus qai s'w presspeteri oi which there·
fore seem to hare reference to the same ampulla, that of the holy ohrism.
But the former of these prayers is evidently out of place, ior it was drawn
up in reference to the oil intended for the auointiug which precedes
baptism, whilst the other has in wiew the anointing which follows it
After the conscerating formulary eomes an exoratam of the eil together
with a eucharistie prayer. 'l'hese two do not seem to fall in with the
ritnal of tho masne, and it is possible that they are Gallicae, aad not
Reman, in origin.

'At first there were twelre lectione, as we see from the Gelasian
Sacramentary. Only four are found iu the Sacramentary oi Adrian, bnt
the ancient enstom, which had been maintained in France, was restored
later on at Rome.
