Itis manifest that these anniversary dates were fixed ³(
arbitrarily‚ and that there was no historical support for
their adoption. St. dames, son of Zebedee, is the only
one among them whose death may be assigned to one
period of the year more than another. But, he was baheaded

about the time of the Passover,¹ and notin the mouth of
December.

The most ancient of thess festivals are those given
in the list of St. Gregory of Nyssa and in the Syriae
Menologion. The festival of St. Stephon goes back, aa we
know, to a period considerably earlier than that of the
discovery of his tomb, which took place iu 415, and gave
a great impulse to his commemoration. Itis mentioned,
moreover, in the Apostolie Constitutionel All Westem
calendars and liturgieal books,8 from the fifth century
onwards, give this festival with its Eastern date.⁴

The festival of the 27th of December was at first

other evangelista, and the festival having thur changed ita character,
St. domos would have boen omitted.

¹ Acts xii. 1-5.

'viii¹ 33. The day is not noted, bnt it could only have beon on
the aeth of December.

'The Leonian Sacramentary preaenta an apparent anomaly. In thia
collection, which is in much diaorder, the Messes in honour of St. Stephon,
the first martyr, instead of being placed at the soth of December, are ranged
under the rubrio of the 2nd of August, along with the Pepe, St. Stephon. It
ia, doubtless, because of the identitytof the name of the Pepe eud the descen,
that the festival of the Invention of the body of St. Stephon (August 3) has
its origin. Thia festival is noted iu the Hieronymian Martyrology, but not
in all tho manuscripts. Ita interpolation, therefore, could have only been
made so far back aa the revision of Auxerre (ca'rc. 595). No ancient
liturgical work, Latin, Gallicae, or Roman (except the Lcouian Sacra·
mentam), contains a festival of the deaeon, St. Stephon, in the mouth of
August. On tho other haud, the festivales tha ἀνακομιδὴ τᾶν λειψάνων τοῦ
ἁγίου Στεφάνου appears ou the ind of August in the Byzantina colendam,
at least from the end of the tenth century (trasimennus &daleam
OroseoSleos'cus, p. 192). lt ia also celebrated by the Armeuieua.

⁴ The Ohurch of thmtautiuopla transfers it to the woh, for it assigna

the day after Christmaa to the commemoration of the Blcased Virgln ond
St. dumph.
