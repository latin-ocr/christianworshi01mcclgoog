copies were made of the Gregorian Sacramentary, and
apparently all the (ihurches were obliged 10 make it the
basis 01 their litmgical use. A considerable number of the
copies executed under Charlemagne and his immediate
successore have been preserved till the present time.
1101101001 L. Delisle has drawn up a catalogue¹ of them,
which will, no doubt, be rendered more complete by further
researches, but which is sufficient to give an idea of the
rapid propagation of the Gregorian text.

The Sacramentary sent by Pope Adrian was, however,
far from containing all the necessary details and formu-
laries. In transcribing it, it was rendered more complete.
In some of the manuscripts, its text homone end to the
other was combined with the Roman Sacramentary which
had been in previous use. ln others-and these are the
most numerous-the copyist merely inserted, as an appendix
10 the Gregorian text, the supplementary matter which
he considered needlul. I doubt whether such a thing
existe as a pure Gregorian text without interpolatione or
additions 01 any kind

But thiais of little moment, since in the large number
of copies in which the Gregorian text is followed by
supplements, these latter are separated from itin 0 very
‹listinct manner, and it is perfectly easy to isolate them.
The author of the supplemented edition hasbeen carelul
to inform us what were the contente of the Sacramentary
properly so called, and the nature 01 the additions
which hc believed it necessary to make. He has prefaced
the latter with an explanatory note and a list 01 the fresh
material added. Hence, there oan be no difficulty in
distinguishing in the Gregorian manuscripts those portions

sicur Dalisle’s catalogue comprises all the Latin Sacramentcrics without
distinction, but the copies of the Gregorien Sacramentary are by far the
most numerous
