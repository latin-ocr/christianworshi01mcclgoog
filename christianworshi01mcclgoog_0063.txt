323), Constantius (set-350), aud Valens <ese-378). When
Gratiau associated Theodosius with him as emperor, he
eutrusted him uu'th the goverumeut of Eustern Illyricum,

which extended northwards as far aethe Save, and west·
warda up to the Dalmatian mountaius. Counected iu this
manner with the Easteru Empire, these provinces could uot
thil to be drawn within the ecclesiastical influeuce of
Constantinople. Greek was spoken throughout most of
them, aud commercial intercourse aud business of every
kind caused a much etrouger drift iu the directiou of
Constantinople thau iu that of Rome or Milan. The Popes,
anxious not to lose the spiritual direction of so many
distinguished Churches, resolved, at an early date, to found
a vicariate at Thessalonica, cf which that at Aries was
merely au imitation. More successfully managed thau its
Gallicau counterpert, it manifested a certain vitality, aud
for nearly a century produced appreciable results. The
schism of long duratiou connected with Acacius (484-519)
iufiicted ou it a fatal blow. Although we find as late as
the eixth aud eeveuth centuriea certain acts indicatiug
papal jurisdictiou in these regions, they are either isolated
instaures, or unconuected with the institution of the
vicariate. Of the latter nothing remained but the titlee,
which the Bishops of Thessalonica and some others
delighted to parade et couucils. Iu fact, if not in
theory, the provinces of Esstem Illyricum had passed
under the authority of the Patriamhs of Constan-
tiuople.¹

At the opposite extremity of the West, the Ohurchea
of Britain, which had been destroyed by or had 'suffered

severely from, the Saron invasion, had not long enjoyed‚
if they had ever known, the metropolitan system.
