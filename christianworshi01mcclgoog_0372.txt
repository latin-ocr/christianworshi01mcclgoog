notice here, in general, to the Leonian Sacramentary
ond that of Pope Adrion. They oontain identically the
same prayers for the ordination oi deacons, priests, and
bishops, and nothing else. There is no mention in them
of any of the orders below the mesonma

3. The Ordines Romani-I have three oi these to
speciiy: (a) that of the manuscript of St. Amand,¹ which
contains only tha Roman ordinatione at the Ember seasons,
that is, those of deaoons and priests; (b) the Ordo VIII.
of Mobillon, which contains in addition the ordination
of the inferior orders, together with that oi biahops ; (c)
the Ordo IV. of Mabillon, in which are given the cere·
monies in regard to descons, priests, bishops, and the
Pope himself. The three Ordines agree in the main with
each other, and the ceremonias which they describe fall
in exaotly with those implied in the two Sacramen-
tar-ies.

4. The Gelonion Sacramentary and the Mieoole mace-
roem—These two compilatione fumish us with the oom-
plete ritual for all the orders; but a slight examination
is enough to convince us that they contain many things
derived from widely different sources. We find therein (a)

a passage of a letter from Pope Zosimus on tha intervals
of time between the orders;2 (b) Chapters Ι. to X. oi the
Statota Ecclesiae Actiqoa3³ (c) ordination prayers lor
tha five inferior orders;⁴ (d) prayers for the ordination
of deaccna, priests, and bishops.⁶ In the last portion,
the Roman prayers, that is, those found in the Leonian
Sacramentary and the Sacramentary of Adrion, are embodied
