Anastasia for Christmas Day, the Greater Litany (April

formularies, though appropriated to the use of other
eountries.

The Sacramentary known as No. 316 was drawn apin

Hilaryand St. Martin. The two other manuscripts, those of
Rheinau and St. Gall, are also Frankish in origin. It is in

Sacramentery under tho Nos 57-62. The prayers in these Messes almost
all resur in the supplement of the Gregorius Sacramentary, Nos. 83-87.
With e single exception, No. 83, tho word certationes is always found
substituted for thet of Βοπιατηιε.
