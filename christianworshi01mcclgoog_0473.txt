of the psalma, antiphona and responde, in the weyers,
litanias or ‘⁴ collects,'’ even in the lections, and the hours
of saying the offices and the times oi the year to be obserwed.
In these, as in the primitive services for Sundeys and
the statione, the suffragan churches followed the usage
of the great metropolitan cathedrale. Provincial ccuncils
did their best tc regulata the details and obtain some sort
cf uniformity. On the other hand, the order of tha offices
constituted one of the principal features of the monastic
rules. The important religious houses followed on this
point the mles which they had adopted; others accepted
the diocesan or provincial usage, as laid down by the
bishops. In the west, down to the ninth century, there
existed no uniformity in this sphera. When at length
uniformity was arrived at, it was due ιο the influence of the
Benedictme mle, and specially¹ ιο that of the great Reman
monasterias which hed sprung up around the basilicas
of tha Iateran, the Vatican, and Santa Maria Maggiore.

These eventually became chapters, first oi regular, then
cf secular monks‚ but they represented in tha main
the principium ct scas of the whole Latin development ot
ecclesiastical and monastic cilices.2

¹ Ι shall contine mysels to pointing out a few facts which may be of
interest ιο those who study the ancient office books At Rome, at all
events down tc the ninth century, hymns were unknown; chants, psalm,
and other Scriptural canticles alone being used The lecticas, at first
reserved for the ancient services of the vigil and the Mass, were not
introduced into the offices until soma time had elapsed, sa. about the
seventh century. 'Phe offlecs, therefore, wera entirely composed oi psalma,
antiphona and responde, and prayara This primitive Roman usage agrees
exactly with what was observed at Jerusalem in the time cf Silvia. 'l'he
rulo oi St. Benedict, on the other hand, admits ot hymns and lecticas See

Mortua. θονοῑιοο, p. 36ος cf. Lair. Pons.,v01. i. p. 231, ncta 1, where I have
made the mistake oi placing tha responde of the cilices in the category ci
later additions.
