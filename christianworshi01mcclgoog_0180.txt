soors or rna 111111 nrrn. 159

In the part before the Prefaoe, 1111 prayers are mestly
arranged according to the Gallican use, and placed under
Gallican rubrics; in nearly one-third of the Messes, how-
ever, the prayers are preceded by Roman rubrica, and are
arranged according to 1111 Roman method. The compilor,
nevertheless, has shown such a want of skill, that in the
Messes of Roman type the prayers are mostly Gaffican, and
ccicc carad. He even places purely Gallican invitatories
under the rubrica belonging 1ο Roman praycrs. In short
all we have in this text is a very bad attempt 1ο combine

the two 11111.ι
Mabillou is of opinion that the Bobbio Missal may have

corne from the province of Besancon, wherein was situated
Luxeuil‚ which was the mother house of 1111 Italian
Convent. He regards the Mass of st. Sigismund as being
an indication in favour of this conjecture. lam unable
to say whether this is so or not. The Mass of St Sigismund
is not a Mass for the anniversery of this saint, hutone
for the cure of the fover-strichen, of whom he was regarded
aa the patron, and that not only in the Scine valley and
Burgundy, but in other districts. I should rather be
inclined to lay strecs on the place from whence the manu-
script came, and on the fact that the name of St. Ambrose
occurs in the Canon of the Mass, a peculiarity not met with
in any other Gallican or Frankish Sacramentery. The
Roman rite, mereover, is here combined with 1111 Gallican in
a peculiar fashion, quite different from that which obtains in
the systema ol combination which we find in 1111 Frankieh
manuscripts of late Merovingian times. It is not exactly
the Ambrosian liturgy, but it is somewhat analogous to it.

¹ The Benedictines of Solesmea bave annonnoed an edition of 11111 book.

One cl 1111111, Dour Cegin‚ has explained his theory in the Pclcoprcpbic
Mordoula, vol. v. p. 97, et aeq.; but 1 cannot shore hia opinions. 1 have
given my reasons in the Beroe d'Hicloc're 11 de Liberale-rc Religionem, vol. v.

(1900), p. 38.
