for the birth of Christ was fixed from the assumed starting-
point of His Pession. Among all the solutions proposed
this seems to me the most satisfactory, but Ι would nos
venture to say, in regard to the 25th of December, that the
coincidence of the Sol acore exercieed no direct or indirect
influence on the ecclesiastical decisione arrived at in regard
to the matter.

2. rte Festinata oster Christusne.

The festivales tho Nativity having been once fixed,
there were associated with it, and that too from an early
date, certain commemorations connected with the greatest
saints of the Now Tostanront. St. Gregory of Nyssa, iri
his funeral oration over sanast, proached at the Cap-1
padocian Caesarea in 379, statos that it was customary after r
Christmas and before the lst cf January to celebrate thei
festivals of St. Stephon, St. Peter, St. dames, St. John, and·¹
St. Paul. This statement is confirmed by the Syriac³
Menologion published by Mr. Wright from a manuscript
of the date 412.1 Ι have made a study of the text of the
latter, and have shown that it is merely an abridgment
of a Greek Martyrology of Asia Minor, of which a more
complete form was embodied in the Latin compilation
called the Hieronymian Martyrology. The Greek Mar·
tyrology is cf the end of the fourth century.8 It is, there-
fore, in the main, of the same date and country ae St. Basil
aud St. Gregory of N ysea. The following are the days after
Christmas which it contains ³ :-
