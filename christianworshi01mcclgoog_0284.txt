a celebretion of the Pession of our Lord on that day, but
alsoa festival of His Resurrection on the 27th of thesemo
mouth, without interfering, however, with the movable feasts
of Good Friday and Eester Sunday.¹

These festival observances imMy an inveterate tradition.
We are not, on this account, to msume that this tradition
hed an historical basis. The Pession cenainly did not occur
on a 25th of March.2 This date must have been arbitrarily
ehosen, or rather suggested, from its coincidence with the
(official) spring equinox. The death of Christ was thus
made to fell on the same day as that on which, according te
an universal belief, the world had been created

This date having once been determined, and determincd,
too, from astronomical and symbolioal consideratione, it was

not unnatural that it should be used to establish another
coincidence. Christ must have lived upon earth, it was

thought, for only a complete number of years. Fraetions
are imperfectiora which do not fell in with the demands ef

a symbolical system of numbers, and hence they must be
got rid of as completely as possible. The Incamation must,
therefore, like the Pession, have taken place on the 25th of
March, and as the Incarnation was reckoned from the first
moment of the conception of Mary, the birth ef Christ must
have taken place on the 25th of December.

This explanation would be the more readily receivedif

Fridsy could not have been either the day of the tewuh Passerer, er the
