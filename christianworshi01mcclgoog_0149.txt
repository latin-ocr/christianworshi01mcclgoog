Ecclesiae, without the name of any Pope. Aa to the text
itself, it contains a great number of things posterior, not
only to St. Gelasius, but to St. Gregory. It 18 therefore
not the Sacramentary itsclf that can have suggested its
attribution to Gelasius, neither can I believe that it was
handed down by tradition. The Gelonion Sacramentary is
derived from official books which were in use in Rome
about the end of the seventh century. Itis noteasy to
believe that at that date a Gelasian Liturgy existed et Rome.
At that period cverything followed tho Gregorian tradition,
not that there was any shrinking from the introduction

they were supposed to follow 11 the lines of the Gregorian

and Oharlemagnc had borne the name of any Pope, it
would doubtless have been that of St. Gregory. We ean,

writers, and was regarded as a great authority. When its

St. Leo and st. Gregory hed added some words to the
canon of the Mass, but that St. Gelenius was the only Pope
who is mentioned by his biographer as the author 11 111111
