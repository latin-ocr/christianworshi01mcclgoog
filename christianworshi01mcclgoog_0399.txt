Hence the obligatior of having three bishops for a con·
secretiori to the episcopata, en obligetion universally accepted
from the beginning ol the fourth century, except where a
consecrator sufficiently qualilied to represent in himself
the collective episcopale is in question.¹

Besides thie intervention of three bishops attha least,
episcopal ordination was characterised, with the same uni·
versality, by the ceremony of the open book of the Gospels
being placed on the head oi the candidate.⁸ This rite, which
was already widely observed in the fourth century, cannot
have been altogether primitive, but itiscertainly very ancient

The anointing peculiar to the Gallioan rite must heve
been suggested by the Old Testament, where we heve
frequent mention of the ancinting of priests. It would
seem not to have been very ancient. Certein indicatione
would lead us to look for its origin in the Ohurohes of
Britain,8 where it was praetised as early as the sirth century.

It was about this period, or rather shortly atter it, that
the traditio of liturgical vestments and other similar insignia
began to take their place among the ceremoniee oi ordina·
tion. I have passed over in silence up to the present the
indicatione furnished on this subject in the Roman &dinsa
and other ritual authorities. This seems the proper moment
to discuss the matter.

¹ Thisisthe case oi the Pope Ishould not bentonlshed illtvsro
lonnd that a similar usage existed in Alexandris3 butl have no procl ol
it. 'l'he Patriarch cl Alexandria, like tho Pope, was the only bishop in
his province at whose ordination the rite ol the imposition ol the Gospel
was used.

'See however, the restrictione pointed cut in the preceding note
Thaso departures, however, do not sttein the seme aniversality ss the
observanceof the rite.

³Gildea is the earliest author vho mentions it. The &aaa know
nothing of it. hbe seme is the case, 1 bolierc, with the Frankrhh writers
ol tho sixth century, end the Sponish up to isidore inclusive. It w
always more widely practised in Grcat Britain than elsewhere. Ol. above,
