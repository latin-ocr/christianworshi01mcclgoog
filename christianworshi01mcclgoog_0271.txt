On the Saturday in Holy Weelr there was no special
meeting for worship. The ceremonias of the Easter Vigil
had already been ,transferred in the eighth century tutha
aftemoon of the Saturday. At the present day they are
performed in the morning. Apart from the ritca in it
which hear upon baptisma] initiation, and which shall bc
described later on, this solemn vigil was distinguished by
certain peculiarities, namely, by the blessing of the new
fire, and of the candle, and by the Mass itself, in which
certain archaic features were preserved.

A very natural symbolism led to the adoption of
these ceremonias The death of Christ, followed quickly
by His resurrection, found an expressive image in the
fire, candle, or lamp, which being extinguished, can be
lit again. We know what importance is still attached
in our own days tc the ceremony of the new firc in the
Easter ritual of the Greek Churoh at Jenraalem. In the
East, however, this ceremony does not extend beyond
the Holy City. It is not found in the ordinary Byzantina
ritual

In the West, we leam from the legend of St. Patrick
thet it was customary for the Irish, as early as the sixth
century, at latest, to kindle great fires at nightfall on
Easter Eva. It appears from the oonespondenoa between
St. Boniface and Pope Zacharias¹ that these fires were
lighted not from other fires, but from fiints. They were
really new fires. This custom appears to have been

peculiar to the British or Irish, and to have been con·
veyed, through the AugioSaxons, to the Continent by

distance from a choreb, even after tho Charcham frea frorn pcmccution. ln
519, Dorotheou, tho Bishop of Themalonioa, fearing that persecution was
about to descend upon his hook, caused the elementa for communion to bc
distributed among them in mahom, cuniam prauo, aa imminente pervc-
maiora manicare acu potami (Thiel, [app. Rura. Pana, vol. i. p. 902).
