Verona manuscript the alternativos are lar greater in number.
Thero ano five Messes, for instance, for tho festivales St.
Ceoilia, nino for Christmas and sor St. Stephen’s Day, eight
for St. Sixtus, fourteen for St. Laurence, twenty-eight for
SS. Peter and Paul, and so lorth3 as to private Messes, they
are given aa libitam, and are legion.

In this enormous collection thero is, as I have romarked,
more material than arrangement. Thus the Whitsuntide
Massia inserted among the Messes for the summer Embor
days; while under the rubrio which announces tho anni·
versery of Pope St. Stephon, on the 3rd of August, we find
only the Messes in honour of St. Stephon, the first martyr.
These latter, on the contrary, do not appear in their proper
placo, that is, between the festivals of Christmas and St. John
tho Evangelist. The Embor days in December are plaoed
ultor Ohmsunm Several Massos pro divesis, or for tho
general office of martyre, aro found in impossible months.
There are some, in July, which prosuppose that the festival
of Easter is still being kept Messes to be said on avigil
are placed altor the festival which they are supposed to
procedo. It would be impossible for an official book to
exhibit such a state of disorder.

It should bo added that tho manuscript contains a

certain number of compositione tho presence of which is
inexplicable in such a book. The brothers Ballorini heve

pointed out a contradiction between tho docroo of Gelasius
De rependis ct aori recipiendis libros and one of the Messes
in tho Sacramentary in question. Itis stated in the latter¹
that the apostlos Peter and Paul suffered, indeed, on tho
some day, but, tompore discreto, in different years. Now, the
docree of Gelasius holds this belief to bo hereticol gossip,
sicae lacerares· porciam. This contradiction would be a
serious one if it were certain, as tho brothers Bollorini
