the Consecration of Altars, followed by eleven Masaes, of
which the first is pro repiboca, the second in commemoration
of St. Hilary, the rest for the common of saints, or for
other purposes. The collection ends with the Caooo aetionis,
that is to say, the Roman Canon, which breaks off with the
manuscript itself at the Nobis quoque.

All the Masses contained in this Sacramentary are
Roman in style and ritual. Here and there, however, we
meet with a few Gallican rubrica, such as post prophetiam,
oete comissa. At the beginning, the ordination prayers
exhibit an unusual complexity, and in this section in·
tenesting resemblances may be pointed out between the
Messala Francorum and the Gelasian Sacramentary. I
am of opinion, however, that they have not been taken one
from the other, nor that they are both copied from ons

original.

4. The Losorion saoarraoeary.

Jossph Bianohini, in 1735, was the first to publish¹ the
text of this Sacramentary, which had been found shortly
before in the Chapter Library at Verona. It is an uncial
manuscript, and, in the opinion of M. Delisle, of the
seventh centtuy.q The beginning of it is mutilated, so
that out of the twelve sections, corresponding to the

¹111 voh iv. of tha Aoosbms'aa Bshfs'othecors’as of his uncle, Fr.
Bianchiui. 'rhis edition was reproducad by Muratori in vol. i. of his
Htorgs‘o omum» setas (1748). The brothers Ballerini have published
another, oollatcd with the original manuscript, in their edition of the works
of St. Leo. This is tha edition found in Migne's Potrolopfo Lot„ vol. lv.
Cf. Delisle, No. 1. A new edition, still more critical, and very convenient
to aemuli, has been lately published at Cambridge by Mt. Peltoe (Socra-
musaeum hamtonam, University Prass, 1896).
