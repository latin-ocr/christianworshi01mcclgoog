offlu’um tuum ιιι impleas illud: potens est euim Deus ut sugast tibi
ΝΜ ;

These words imply¹ that there hed previously been
an eleotion. The election having been announeed, the
pontiff delivera an eddrese to the congregation,2 in which

he dwells upon the tuith and ebility oi the candidate,
aud then, in sight of all the people, pute into his hand
the book from which he was to read, saying-

Aooips‚ et esto verbi Dei relator, habitnms, si fideliter et utiliter
impleveris officium, partem oum his qui verbum Dei ministraverunt

'l'hen follows the prayer-

Domine saneto, Peter omnipotens, aeterne Deus, benedicere digneris
tumulum tuum nomios Illum in offioio lectoris, ut assiduitate lectionum
dhtiuoms atque ornatus euris modulis spirituli devotione resonet
ecelesiae.³

¹ They sppsur in the two Seemmentaries under the title Praefatio
boswile, thus forming a eounterpurt to the invitatorias employed ior the
other orders; but their form is widely different. I have been inclined to
pleee them at the beginning oi the eoremony, that is, et the moment
indioated by the sense of tho formulery. The blessing would thus
appear without sn invitatory. Perheps the address ot the bishop took
its pleoe: but thie is not very probeble. The Pontifloel now in uee has
u speoial invitetury.

¹ Onr manuscripts give us no formulary for this addrem. There is one
in the existing Pontideul‚ es well aa ior the three other minor orders, portur,
uxorein, end eoolyte. 1 nm not oenain ss to the exuet date ot their origin:
but it must be very early.

⁸ This text, which is thet oi the Gelasisn Suoramentary, is eorrupt eud
unintelligible ιιι the end Thet oi the Misenis Fraoooram is not in a
better state: Ut assiduitate ιιωιίοιιιιιιι distitutae utque ordinatus euris
motolo opiritrli ‹isootiom linqua resonet selaeu. In the existing Pontilleal ¹
ιι luoid text is found hero, derived trorn the teregnum but it olearly betrays
the teet of sarug been touohed up.
