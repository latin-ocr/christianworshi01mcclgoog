anderen ol liturgioal Synexes. Aa Alexandria, however,
the Synaxes wera not liturgicah Thia omission of the
liturgy was peculiar to tho city of Alexandria itself, for in
the interior of Egypt the liturgy was said in the evening,
and was preceded by an agape.¹ It might ho imagined that
this observance cf Saturday wasa primitive attempt to
reconoile the Jewiah and Christian uses. But os these
Saturday servitos are not mentioned by any author before
the fourth century, and as, moreover, they wera unknown at

Rome, it is more natural to suppose that they were a later
institution. Besides this,‚the Eastern Ohurch, while adopt-
ing tho observance ol Saturday, was extremely careful to
eliminate fremit the chief characteristic of the Jewish
Sabbath, namely, the obligaticn to observo it as a day of
reat.²

In the West, and particularly at Rome, Saturday became

a day ol lasting. As early as the time of Tertullian,
there were Ohurches in which the Friday fast was occa-

sionelly prolonged to the Saturday. This was called .

coatiaaaarc jejuniam,³ an expression which was superseded
lator on by the term superponere jejuniam, which is merely
an unsatisfactory attempt to translate into Latin the Greek
word ὑπερτίθεσθαι (to protraat). These prolongod fasta
wore very common at the end of the third century. Refer·
anceio mado to them in one of the writings oi Victorinus,⁴
Bishop of Pettau The Council cf Elvira enjoins the
observance oi one such fast every mouth, except in July
and August, and at the same time abolishes the weekly

“superposition,” which had up till then boon obssrwod
