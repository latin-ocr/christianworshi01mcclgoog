of the collection may be confirmed by a mors careful study
of the manuscripts.

The most ancient of them, No. 316 of Queen Chris·
tina’s collection, is, in the opinion of Mons. Delisle,1 “of
the seventh or beginning of the eighth century.’' This
opinionis confirmed by interual evidence. We find, for
instance, no mention in it of the stations for the Thursdays
in Lent, instituted by Gregory 11.(715-731). The Romen
original was therefore earlier than the death of that Pope.
On the other hand, we find in it cassin things which could
not have been introduced before the seveuth century, vica
aspicedum Sancti Gregorii ραριιο9 (Ι. 21), the Wednesday,
Friday, and Saturday staticus before the First Sunday in
Leut, the four festivals of the Virgin, and that of the
Exultation of the Oross. The latter five festivals areposten'or
'to the time of St. Gregory (d. 604) and earlier than Pope
Sergius (687-701);³ that of the Exultation must have doubt·
less been introduced after the discovery of the true cross
by Heraclius (628). We cannot therefore determine within
acentury (628-731) the date of the Roman original of our
Sacramentary.

Icall it the Roman original. I ought ratberto say the
Roman model, or franework, for the Gelasian manuscripts
are far from having preserved for usa Roman text, free
from all interpolatione. In the most ancient copy all
topographical indicatione have discppeared Not one of
the basilicas in Rome is mentioned All the prayers
having reference to certain observancss peculiar to Roman
ritual are likewise suppreesed, such as the Mass of St.
