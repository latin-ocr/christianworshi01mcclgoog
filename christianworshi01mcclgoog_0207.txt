oblato and demi-oblata placed upon the paten. From the time
of Pope Sergius (cst-701) this ceremony was accompanied
hythe chantiug of the Aprica Dei. It is probable that
before the time cf St. Gregory the Pctcr acalcr was said
at this time, that is, after the fraction.¹

The fraction having been performed, the deacons present
· to the Pope the paten, from which, taking a fragment, he
detaches a particle and consumes the rest. He then puts
the detached portion into the chalice, which the archdeacon‚
who has brought it from the altar, holds before him. This
is the rite cf the Comrraiatio. The Pope thereupon drinks
from the chelice, which is presented to him aud held by
the archdeacon.

Thau comes the communion of the superior clergy. The
bishops and priests approach the Pope, who putslinto the
hands of each a fragment taken from the paten. They then
proceed to the altar, and each one, putting on the holy table
his hand containing the consecrated bread, then communi·
cates. The deacons do the same after them. The arch·
¹ deacon brings back the ohalice to the altar and puts it into
the hands of the senior bishop present, whc‚ after having

drunk from it, presente it to the other bishops, and then to
the priests and deacons. The communion of the congre-
gation then follows. The Pope and the bishops and priests
distribute the Eucharist under the species of breed. The

books there is no prayer preparatory tutha communion. In the Gallioan
Litnrgy wc flnd in this placa the beneffiotiom and in the Greek liturgica
prayors of similar import are prescribed here. 'l'he hiatus which appears
here in the Roman Mass must hare been occasioned by tha removal of
the Pater meter tc another placa. This tiator isat the prcscut time filled
up by tho private praycrs of the priest.
