At the first scrutiny the elect gave in their names,
which were inscribed in a register. Thau the sexes were
separated, the men being placed on the right, and the
women on the leit.

The Mass then began After ths collect and before
the lectione, a deacon called upon the catechumene to

prostrate themselves in prayer. The prayer was con·
cluded by all of them saying in a loud voice, Amce.

Alwaye at a signal from the deaoon they sigued themselves
with the sign ol the cross, saying, Io amalae Patria, etc.
The eroroisms took place at this point in the service.
One of [the clergy‚¹ whose duty it was, approached thc
male candidates, end having mede the sign of the cross on
the forehead of each, imposed his hands upon each and

pronounced tha formulary of exorcism. He then procaedcd
to the female candidates, and repeated the ceremony. A
second exorcist followed him, and then a third, performing
the same act. Ι give here one of the formularias used-

Deus Abraham, Daue Isaac, Deus Jacob, Dens qui Moysi famulo tuo
in monte Sinai apparuisti et filios Israel de terra Aegypti eduxisti,
deputans eis angelum pietatis tusc qui cumodhet eos die ac nocte;
ts quaesumus, Domine, ut mittere digneris sanctum angelum tuum
ut similiter custodiat st hos famulos tuos et perducat eos ad gratiam
baptismi tui.

llrgo,² maledicte diabole, recognosce sententiam tuam et da honorem
Deo rivo et vero, et da honorem lesu Christo Filio ajus ct Spiritui
sancto; et recede ab his famulis Dei, quia istos eibi Daue et dominus

¹'1'he Ordo and tha Socroereotory mention acolytos iu this place,
but it is certain that ae long aa there were exorcista in edice, this was
not the duty ol acolytos

² This portion oi tbe formulary ie invariable. It is repeated at each
ol the six exorcisma.
