hir. Edmund Bishop, in his notos on tho Book cf Com (the Prsyer
Book oi Aodclwuld tho Bishop, commonly called “The Book of Cerne,”
editcd by Doni A. B. Kuypors, Cambridge, 1902 [p. 237} note 7), hes pointed
out, ond with reason, thet in Muretori's edition of the liturgic Renum

Gregorian Soeromontory to the shnpe in which it is presented by the Mes,

slight modification, to the observatione which 1 heve nlreedy mode on the
