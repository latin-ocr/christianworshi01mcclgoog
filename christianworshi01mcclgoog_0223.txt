By the second half of the sixth centrny the cate·
chumenate hed become merely a reminiscence. It was
necessary then to explain the nnec (dismissed) catana
nwnomn of which the rite, however, continued to be
preserved.a 'lhis ceremony took place after the prayer,
as in the Liturgy oi Constantinopla In the Apostolic
Constitutione it is placed before the prayer. We cannot
gether precisely from the text of St. Germain whether it
waa accompanicd by special prayers. I am inclined to
believe that its text has in view the prayers which Ι
have just dealt with, but that at the beginning there
were special prayers, which disappeered with the dis·
appearance of the catechumena. Thus, at the end cf the
eixth century, at least in the Church of Paris, nothing
more was said than some such formulary aa Ne qnia oote-
'oleeanenaa oatoohameoei raderet, etc.

procedere commonentur.”
