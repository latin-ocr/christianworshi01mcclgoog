Romen custom, better observed et Rome then elsewhere,
recourse was hed to legende without any foundation.l

As to the mitre, we heve no reason to treet of it here,
es it does not come into question till the eleventh century.
Indeed, neither in the eleventh century nor ct the present
time cen it be said to constitute en episcopal sign of office,

properly speaking.

The eruditio of vestments or ecclesiasticel insignis hed
its place in the rituel oi ordination. The texts of St. Isidore
end of the fourth Oouncil of Toledo, cited above, make
express mention of it, but do not stete ct what moment in
the ceremony it took place. The other documents of the
Goilican rituol ure silent on this point. In the Romen
Ordines of the eleventh century we find the erchdeecon
clothing the candidates in the vestments of the order about
to he conferred on them, and presenting them to the Pope
thus apperelled to receive the blessing for the dieconete, the
priesthood‚ or the episcopucy. This ceremony took place in
frontes the alter, in the special enclosure, or presbyterium,
beyond the epse, where the pontiff, surrounded by the highcr
clergy, was enthroned. The vestmente thus solemnly con·
ferred were-the orarium with the dalmatic for demone,
end the planete for priests. Bishops were invested with
both dalmatic end planete, the latter being worn over the
former.

¹ The story, for instenoe‚of the staff of St. Peter, which was confided to ι
missionery bishop, thet he might rcetore life to one of his conperiens who
hed died on the journey. Innoccnt 111.(1)0 Ale. Mysi, i. 62) is the first to
here giren this explnnetion. He connects it with the legend oi St
Eucherius oi Treves At the time thet he wrote, the seme story m related
about several other seinte.
