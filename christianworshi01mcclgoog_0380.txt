We have seen that in the ordination 61 deacons and
priests the entire rite, according to Roman usage, consiste 61
prayere—some offered in common by the whole congregation,
and others recited by the Pope over the prostrate candidate.
The ceremonial in the case of bishops was not more complex.

The bishops consecrated by the Pope were almost
always those of his own metropolitan provinca. They were
not chosen by him, but elected in their several localitiee.

up, which is signed by the notahlee'of the place, both clerical
and lay, and the future biehop thereupon sete out, accom-
panied by some representatives of hie Ohurch, for Rome,
where the electionis verified and the candidate examined.

approves 61 the choice 61 the electore, the consecration
follows. There was no special time in the year assigned to
this cercmom‘al, but 16 had always 66 take place on a
Sunday.

the Litany and Kprtc were deferred until after the Grsduel.
When thie had been sung, the Pope called on the congre-
gation to pray, and then all present prostrated themselves

Pope arose and recited ovar the candidate 6 prayer compoeed
61 two formulariae, of exactly the same type ae that used
for descons and priests. The new bishop then arose, and
having received the embrace 61 the Pope, bishops, and
priests, took hie place at the head 61 the bishops, The
choir then sang the Alleluia, or Tract, and the Mass was
continued in the usual manner. I append here the special
formularies used for the ordination of bishope :-
