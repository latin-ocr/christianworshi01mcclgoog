The ecclesiastical local body was at first constituted and
organised on the model furnished by the Jowish communities,
or at least under the influence of exigencies similar to those
by which the Jewish communities themselves had been
instituted and developad. Owing to the continuous advance
madeinthe propagation of tha Gospel, there comeatime when,
as a very early writer has remarked, “the children of the barren
woman stupassed in number those of the fruitful woman.”¹
The Christim population in each town rose from being an
insignificant minority to a respectable minority, became
afterwards the majority, and at length embraced the whole
population. It passed through these various pheses indifferent
localities at widely different dates. Phrygia was almost
entirely Christian when Gaul possessed only a very small
number of organisedOhurches. The fourth century witnessed
the final stage of this change in nearly every region, at least
as far as the mass of the people in the towns were concemed.
This immense development modified but very slightly the
hierarchical organisation of the Churches. The number of
ordained ministare increased; some changes, some specialiss-
tion of power arose, but the govemment remained monarchical
throughout It even tendad to become more and more so.
The priests continued to be the comendatus substitutas,
the assistente of the bishop; the deacons and other lassor
ministers were still engaged in temporal duties, charitable
works, and the minor details of the service of God.

Roman municipal institutions, such as theusetae, the
decemuiri, and the carawres, fumished no models for imitation
