136 CHRISTIAN woesmr: Ire ostem hun evonimos.

twelve months of the year, nine only ere now remain-
ing, end the fourth, that of the month of April, is
incomplete. The loss of the first three months is much
to be regretted, for these contained the paschal ceremonias,
which constitute the most interesting part of the Socra-
mentories.

tht remeius of the month of April is divided into
thirty-nine sections, comprising ss many¹ Messes in honour
of variorm martyrs. The martyrs are not mentioned by
name,⁹ so thet the formulariee may be used in commemora-

tion of any martyr. The month of May contains the Messes
of the Ascension, of Pentecost, and of the summer Ember

days. In the month of June we have the Messes in honour
. of St. John Baptist, SS. John and Paul, and the Apostles
Peter and Paul In Juty the only festival given iethet
of the Seven Brothers. Tbese are followed by a considerable
number of Messes and prayers for divers occasions. In
the month of August we find setill greater number cf
festivals-that of Pope St. Stephon (August 2), thet of
SS. Xystus, Felicissimus, and Agapitus (August 6), thet

of St. Laurence (August 10), that of SS. Hippolytus and
Pontianus (August 13), end SS. Adsuetus and Felix (August
30). In September we heve the festivals of SS. Cornelius
ond prrian (September 14), St Euphemia (September 16),
of the dedication of the Ohurch of St. Michsel on the Via
Salaria (September 30), followed by the autumn Ember
days, the prayers used et ordinatione and for the notate of

bishops, priests, and deacons, for the benediction of virgins,
and for marrisges. There are no festivals in the month

¹ And even a few more. The numbers sre sometimes incorrectly placed,
so that tuo Messes are εἰνοιι under one hesding.

2 These Messes were, however, drawn up st the ontset for the anniver-
saries of epooifled martyre, cf whom they originally contained the names.
But these liure been suppressod, although two os them still remcin,
those of St. Tiburtius (No. 6), and St Gregory‚ or rather St. George
(No. 33).
