are attributed to him, and 0010 eyetematic and official
collection.¹ Thia, however, proved sufficient to give 1100
10 the idea that Gelasiue had put forth a Sacramentary.
On 1110 arrival of Pope Adrian'e mieeive, the Franks had
found themselves 1000 to face with a Sacramentary attri-
buted to St Gregory, and differing from that which they
had known hitherto. Thenceforward the latter could ba
aa none other than that of Gelasiue, and 11110 idea having
once taken hold 01 the minda cf toachers like Alcuin and
othere, it was inevitable that it should spread widely and
rapidly. Among the hranches of etudy over which these
learned 1000 preeided, there were few of greater importanee
and 01 01010 practica] applicaticn than 1110101 the liturgy.

The Gelaeian Sacramentary became a subject 01 teaching
in the 00110010, and 110 position thenceforward was im·
pregnable.l

In our opinion, no weight can he attached to 11110
designation. By the term Gelaaian Sacramentary we

must understand 0 Reman liturgical collection introduced
’ 1010 Franco 00100 time before Adrian, and certainly sub-
sequently to St. Gregory. This conjecture 00 10 the date

written afterwards, “tractatae diversarum 001101ον01010 et aocramcdoram''
(11101, 0. 257).

‘Thia explanation 10 0 puro hypothesis. But in 00110 01 110 001

00 better one hae aa yet boen put forwerd. It hae boen auggeeted that

St. 00001100, aa ie aeen by 1110 Homiliee, never uaed any except the
Gallican Liturgy. Wileon (op. 011, p. lxi.) properly remarks, that ii Alcuin,
