perseeution¹ It was also observed in the countries following
the Gallican rite. Ammianus Marcellinus² relates that, in
361, Julian, who was already ill-disposed towards Con-
stantius, but who continued to disguise his pagan leanings,

wes publioly present at the Christian religious service in
Vienna on the day of the Epiphany, seriorum die wem relo-

draatea owart januario christiani Epe'ptuoio dictitarat. The
Oounoil ol Saragossa (380) mentions it also (.4) as a
very high festival⁰

At Rome and in Africa the festivales the 6th of Januery
was as little known es that of the 25th of December among
the Orientals.⁴ The Epiphany does not ooour in the Philo·
oalian emendor, and tho Donatista did not keep it. St.
Augustino reproaches them with this in terma which imply
that the festival had been imported from the East, quia aee
acuitatem emeat, uec miratorii aalma . . . ammentante
The two festivals were accepted everywhere in the West
from the beginning of the fifth century, except among the
Donatista

Itis thus clear that towards the end of the third century
tha custom of celebrating the anniversary of the birth of
Christ had spread throughout the whole Choreb, but thet
it was not observed everywhere on the same day. In the
West the 25th of December was chosen, and in the East
the 6th of ‹lanuary The two customs, distinct from each
other at first, carne finally to be combined so that the two
festivals were universally observed, or almost so.
