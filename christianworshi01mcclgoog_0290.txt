We have seen that the Armenian Calendar provides in
the last days of December for a special festival in honour of
the two relatives of Christ, King David, aud James, “the

brother of the Iord.’' The person who has in this respect
an incontestabls right to a special commemoration among
the festivals of the Nativity is assuredly the Blessed virgin.
We need not, therefore, be astoniehed that ber festival finds a
place immediately after Christmas in the Nestorian Calendar.
A similar festival appears also in the Coptic Calendar on the
16th of Janusry, almost immediately after the solemnitiee
of the Epiphany, which came to an end ou the 14th.

In Gaul also we find, in the sixth century, a festival
of tbe Blessed Virgin in the montb of January: mediante

Martyrology, in its revised Auxerre form (circ. 595), assigna
this festival to the 18tb of January.² It appears also
- in tbe liturgica] books in this part of the calendar, but with
somewhat lese precision.

Her festival was celebrated in Spain, but at various
dates iu various places. The tenth Council of Toledo (656)
enjoins a fixed and universal date, the 18tb os December,
eight days before Ohristmas.⁸ ι

¹ Glor. Mart, 8. There ie no earlier attestation ae far ae Gaul is

(Greg. Tur, Her. Fr, x. 31).

² In the Luxeuil Lectionary it follows the ane Sunday alter Epiphany,
before the festival of cathedra Petri, which was then celebrated on the
lethot lanuary. In tho Missole Gabbam it occurs between Epiphany
and St. Agnes (alst January); in the Sacramentary of Bobbio, between
Epiphany and Lont, with (sudaster) tho festival of the Chair of St. Peter.
'l'he Hieronymian Martyrology gives the two sastivale on the seme day.
