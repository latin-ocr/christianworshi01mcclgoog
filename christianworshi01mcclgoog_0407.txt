that is, ol a specics ol participation in the Pasce ovea creua
As early aa the sixth century the Bishops of Arles, aud
in the following century those of Canterbury‚ wore it aa
amark of the special powers which they hed received irom
Rome.

On the conclusion ol the alliance between the Pope and
the Carlovingian princes, when the Frankish cnuroh found
itself more closely relatedtoRome, the metropolitane accepted
the Roman palliam with the symbolism attached to it.

This conception cf the pallium as a mantle was
suggested rather by the word itself than by the thing
denoted. The article designated by this term was not in
the form ol agarment, but of a scerl. In the last analysis
this scari was, no doubt,a relic cf the short mentle which
had been brought into fashion in the Roman Empire by the
Greeks. But the discolora palleo ol the Theodosian (lode
were evidently scarves, and scarves of office, which were
worn over the poenaria, es the pontifice] pallium was worn
over the planeta The Theodosian Code mentions this sign
of office only in connection with functionaries of a com·
paratively humble rank, but the monuments represent it
on the shoulders of considas fact which gives ground for
belief that the Imperial Government conferred, in reality,
a very great mark of honour on the ecclesiastical dignitaries
upon whom they bestowed it.

A glauce at a consular diptych‘ will illustrate what
I mean. The consul is there represented in the most
solemn act of his inauguration, viz. at the moment

when he gives the signal to start the horsea in the creua

palliam of Alexandria (Liberatus, Rrec, 20)
