the seaeon of Lent. The meetings for this purpose were
called acclinia& aud in the seventh century amounted to
seven in number. No Romen collection of catecheticai
instructions is now in existence which might be compared
with those oi St. Cyri] of demselem, but the latter is
sufficient to give us eu idea of the nature and form oi the
teaching given preparatory to baptism.1

of the evil spirit by forcing him to relinquish his hold
over those who were about to pass into the kingdom of
Christ.
