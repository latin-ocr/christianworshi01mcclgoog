rne 88888 urse. 163

The orcita of the eighth century represent them es wearing
their liturgica] vestments, and as preceded by the sub·
deaeons, one of whom swings a censer,¹ and by seven
acolytos carrying tapers.² During this procession the
cheir (schole 8888188818) sings the antiphon acl introitum.
Originally 1118 antiphon consisted of the singing of a com·
plote psalm, or, at least, of several verses 81 it. It con·
tinued to be sung until the pontiff had reached the altar.
Before hadid 88, 18 was met bya cleric, who brought to
him a fragment of consecrated breed, which was reserved
from a previous Mass. This eucharistie portion was in·
tended to be placed in the chaliee before the ceremony
ef the “ fraction 81 118 bread.” On entering the sanctuary
the Pope gave the kiss 81 peace 18 118 senior biahop
and senior priest, and then to all his deaeons. He
thereupon proceeded 18 prostrate himself before the holy
table. A few minutas before his arrival there, the book
of the Gospele had been solemnly brought and placed upon
the altar. After the Pope's prostration, the deaeone pro·
ceeded two by two end kissed the altar on its sides. The
pontiff also, drawing near, kissed the altar, 88 well as the
book of the Gospels.

It is diffieult to assign a precise date te this cere-
mony. In 811 rituale the entry 81 118 officiating minister
was from an early time associated with some pomp. We
shall not go far wrong, however, 11 we refer 18 118 fifth

¹ Jndging from the Ordines audather liturgieal 18818, 88 well ae from
the inventories of Church furniture which wc find in tho faber Ponti·
fienda the portablc censor was used 81 Rome, up to tho ninth century, only
in precessione. The route whieh 118 certeco had to follow was thus
made sweetemelling with incense. As for ceomng tho altar, or the ohureh,
or the clergy or congregation, 8881 8 thing 18 never mentioned

Ἰ fancy that there must have been some connection between 118
eustom of carrying, on certain 8888818881, tepere before the Pope and before

118 book of the Gospels, and the tepere tiguring among tho insignia of
the highest dignitariee of 118 Roman Empire in the 11811118 ‹lignitate-m

imperii.
