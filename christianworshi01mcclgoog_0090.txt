2. 'Mesopotamia aad Peraia.

There is no doubt that the Ghurchss ol' Mesopotamia
and Persia were founded by missionaries who came
from Antioch. But the difference of language end of
politica] allegiance in these regions soon gave a special
feature to these Ghurches, and did not fail to have an
influenoe on their liturgioal uses. It is somewhat diffi-
cult to diffmentiete here between Edessa and Seleucia·
Ctesiphon.

The Nestorian communities of tha ancient Sassanid

kingdom have preserved liturgias, the original provectuum
of which may be either of these two metropolitan citios.
At the closo oi the fifthl century the Nestorians of Edessa
overran Persia, and there is no reason to suppose that Ι

thoy did not carry thither many of their country's customs.
Howevor this may be, the Nestorian liturgias may be
considered to represent the type adopted in the countries
beyond tha Euphrates, where the liturgical lenguaga was
exclusively Syriae. We must at the present time dis·
tinguish between the Nestorians properly so called, who
heve kept themselves together with their national patriarch
in the mountains of Kurdistan,² and the Uniat or Chaldean
Nestorians, who have at their head a Catholio Patriarch
residing at Mossul. These two dignitaries‚ who bear the
title of Patriarchs of Babylon, are representatives of the
successiones the ancient Catholicae of Seleucia.8
