certain times were also singled out, either in accordance
with Holy Scriptura, or Jewish tradition, or even in
agreement with the eustoms of ordinary and civil life.
It was natural to take advantage of the moment when
the family met together for the midday meal, and later
on, when they again separated, to continue the evocatione
of their daily life. Two regular times of prayer were thus
obtained-two hecra observed privately, but habitually.
Others, calling to mind that Daniel prayed three times a
day, ocncluded that it would be profitable to follow his
example. The three honre were indicated in the Acts
ol the Apostles, where we sec the disciples guthered
together for prayer at the honr of rice, when the Holy
Spirit came upon them on the Day of Pentecost3 st.
Peter goes up to the roof of the house to pmy, at the
hour of sect, before partalring ol his meal; aud finally,
the apostlcs Peter and John enter the temple for prayer
at the honr of coac. These honre, moreover‚ constituted
the principal divisione of the day3 they were observed
for business, and were marked by the call of the city

It is from Tertullien that we learn the observance of
these three “honre’' of the day, and it is he who thus ex·
plains their origin. Clement of Alexandria was also aware'
of this division of the Christian day. In his Cathemerinon
Prudentius appears to take his inspiration from a some·
what different custom, that which I first described, but
with the hours of matins and vespere doubled. There ie
a hymn for the honr when the cock crows, Alce dici
cautium, another for the dawn, Noc et craece ct achila ‚·
others are written for before and after the midday meal,
