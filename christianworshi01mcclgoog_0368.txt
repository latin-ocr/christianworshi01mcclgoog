referred to. The series of their epitaphs begins as early
as the second century on monuments which are probably
anterior to Tertullian, who is the first writer to mention
them.¹ In the fourth century this order was pre-eminently
the first 01 the ministry, and constituted a sort of proba·
tionary stage. Young clerice began their career in it, and
remained lectore until they hed reached an adult ege,
which was a necessary qualification for receiving superior

orders.² Most of the ecclesiastieal carcers of which the
details are known to us began with the lectorate. Such
was the case with st. Felix of Nola St Eusebius 01 Vercelli,

the father of Pope Damasus, the Popes Liberius and
Siricius, Messius Romulus the Deaeon of Fiesole, St.
Epiphanius of Pavia, and many 0111000.Β It need not
therefore excite surprise that this order was extremely

to St. Laurenco, in 258. The decretulo 01 Popes Siricins, Zosimus, and Gela·
sius (leffe, 255, 339, 633), bearing on promotion in the eeclesiastical career,
do not speak 01 doorkecpers as a step to entering that calling. Gelesius,
who alone mentions this order, raises a distinction between it and tbc others,
by snying theta knowledge 01 letters is obligatory before entcring orders, Ἰ
and that without it, eis serieres ostiarii (pah) possit implore ministeriam.
Tbe Liber Pont. contains (vol. i. pp. 164, l‘ll) two enumeratione 01 the
ranke 01 the hierarchy; the order 01 doorkeopers figures only in the second:
tho 0000111010οη siluestri omits it five times out 01 seven in enumeratione
01 the same nature. Iknow 01 no Romen inscription which mentions this
011100. Itis met with iu a law 01 337 (cod. raca, xvi, xii. 21); see
also the 'Eresos inscription, Le Blaut, 292, and the letter 01 88. Lupus
and Euphronius (Hardouin, 00001100, vol. ii p. 791). 'l'he doorkeepers were
