suppose, thet the decree concerning the books 10 really
attributable to Gelasius, 01, indeed, 10 any Pope. As this
point appears 10 me to be difficult of solution, I shall
confine myself to pointing out aeertain number 01 01010000
in the Sacramentary which give expression 10 unexpected
and rather stertling sentimenta. There are actual declama·
tiens against monks, unworthy monks it is true, but such
declamation in any case is singular. God is called to
