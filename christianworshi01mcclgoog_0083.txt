62 canistris wossml’: Its ORIGIN AND evermor,

to regerd the oblation with favour, and to cause to

descend upon it the virtue of His holy Spirit, in order

that it may be mede the body and blood of Christ, the
spiritual food of His faithful psople, and the pledge of their

immortality.

The eucharistie prayer proper comes thus to an end.
The mystery is consummated, At the eall of His disciples
Christ has become present in their midst. He hes taken up
His abode on thesacred altar under the mystic veils of the
consecrated elementa. The prayers are resumed, but directed
now to the present, although invisible, God. Itis no longer
the descon, an inferior minister who speaks and conducta
the supplicatione, but the bishop himself, the head of the
Christian community:

“Lord, we pray to Thee for Thy holy Ohuroh spread
abroad from one end of the world to the other.. . for
myself who am nothing. . . for these priests, for these
deacons, for the emperor, the magistrates, and the army . . .
for the saints who in all ages were enabled to plesse Thoe,
patriarche, prophete, the righteous, apostles‚ and martyra . . .
for this psople, for this city, for the siok, for those who are
under the yoke of slavery, for the eriles, the prisoners,
seiiors, travellers . . . for those who hate us and perse·
cute us . . . for the catechumene, the possessed, the
penitents . . . for regularity of the seesons, for the
fraite of the earth . . . for the absent.'' At the end of
this long prayer is a doxology, te which the whole congre·
gation responde Amen, thus ratifying the act of thanks·
giving and intercession.

The Peter Noster¹ is now recited, accompanied by a new

but very short Diaconal Litany, in which some of the
subjecte already enumerated by the bishop in his long
