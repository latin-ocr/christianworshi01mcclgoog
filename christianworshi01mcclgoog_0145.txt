hie day, remarked that St. Gragory could not have mentioned
his own feshval, and he also notos ae later additions tho
Messes for the Nativity and the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, and those for certain days of Laut. He has further
denoted hyan obelus¹ whatever he considered to be an
interpolation. Indead, besides the Mass oi St. Gregory
himself, we must reject those for the four festivals of the
Bleesed Virgin, not only those for her Nativity and Assump-
tion, but even those for the Purifioetion and the Annunciation,
end the festival of the Exultation of the Oross, these holy
days not having been introduced into Rome till during the
course of the seventh century. With regard to Ient, the
statione of the Thursdays are not older than Gregory II.
(7 15-7 31), whereas the stations of Aah Wednesday and the
following days, up to the First Sunday in Lent, are more
ancient, but at the same time still later than st. Gregory.
Another addition is evident in the station of January let,
given as ad st. Mariam od Martyres, since this Churoh,
that is, the Pantheon, was not consecrated for Christian
worship until the time of Pope Bonifaoe IV. (eoa-615).
Its dedication ia indicated ou May 13th, so that here
again we have a festival posterior to St. Gregory. Tha
sume applies te the dedication of St. Nicomede, on June
lst, this Chnroh having been consecrated under Bonifaoe V.
(ola-625). The Ohurehes of St Adrion, St. Andrew near
the Lateran, St. Lucy, St. Georgo, st. Theodoro, aud St.
Apollinaris, mentioned aa stational Ohurohes, are, the three
first of the time of Honorius (eae-638), the others probably
later. Finally, the festival of Pope St. Leo, indicated on
June 28th,is the anniverea1y,not of his death, but of the
translation of his relies under Sergius² (oet-701).

¹ Aa far as 1 am aware, tho employment of this obelus hoe not been
pointed ont in any oi the manuscripts still extant.

' 1t should also be noted that on the aeth of July wo lind under the
rubrio SS. Faceta, Simplicio, Fuaata'aa' concamaratae ln honour oi St.
Felix only. 'l'hia suggesta that the translation oi the three other martyra
had already talren place. It occurred under Lao 11. (682-683).
