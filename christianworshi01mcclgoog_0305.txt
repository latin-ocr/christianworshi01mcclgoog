and indubitobly of the second century, like Pope Tele-
sphorus and St. Justin Martyr—wera not inscribed in the
ecclesiastioal oalendars of the time of Constantine. The
anniversarias inserted in these calendars refer to martyre
of the third century at the earliest The Christian epitaphs
at Rome, moreover, belonging ιο adata earlier than the
third century, contuin no indication of the day of tha
death of the deceased, whether they were martyrs or not.
The case would have been different ilas early as this, the
funeral anniversary had become the subject of a religious
commemoration, and, as far us the martyra were aoncemed,
of an ecclesiastical solemnisation. From the beginning of
the third century, on the other hand, the celebration of the
anniversary became a matter of universal observance.

The anniversarias of martyre were, naturally, local festi·
vals. Each Church honoured its own saints. Sometimes,
owing, it may be, to the lach of special festivals for each
martyr, or in the way of addition to these festivals, a general
commemorationes all the martyre of a locality was celebrated.

The practice soon arose of one Ohurch adopting the com-
memoratione of another, and thus the festivals of the most
distinguished saints were celebrated elsewhere, as well as in
their own country. Some even attainedanalmost oecumenioal
veneration, such as St Xystus [Sixtus] and St. Laurence of
Rome, and St. Cypriam of Carthago, etc. The translation
of relies, real or representative, gave, frum the fourth century
onwards, a great impulse to this form of veneration, and to
the festivals associated with it

There soon came to be associated with the martyro the
holy confessore, that is, the ascetae, using the term in its
fourth-century significance, such as St. Martin, St. Anthony,
St. Simeon stylites, eto.

Among the looal festivals there must also be mentioued
the anniversarias of the dedicatione of churches, and of the
ordination (octob) and burial (depoa'tio) of bishops.
