3. l'he Gelasian Sacramentary, which agrees generally
with the Ordc; but here, eleo, possible ‚Gallican revision
has to be taken into account.

The almost complete agreement between the Gelasian
Sacramentary and the Ordo Baptc'rcci proves that the latter
represents the custcm cf the seventh century at the latest
From semein details, such as the bilingual formularles, the

emplcyment cf the Nicene Cread, the substitution oi
acolytes for exorcista, we are forced to the conclusion that

this ritual was not finally drawn up until the course ol
the seventh century, thetis, in Byzantina times.

At this period the baptism cl adults had become
exceptional‚ and the rites of initiation were ordinerily
confiued to inlants. Thus the Ordo and the rubrica oi
the Sacramentary spesk of infante in arms, who are
accompanied by godfathers and godmothers to auswer in
their names. Itis clear, however, that the formulsn'es were
composed lor adults, and that the ceremonies themselves

have only their full significares where persons oi riper
years are concerned. It is necessary, therefore, in order
to place the whole in its true light, to regard the details

which limit the ceremony to infants, and thus cause a
chronological transposition of the whole text, as indicatione
ol the work of a reviser. Ι will endeavour, therefore, to
take this into consideration in the following description.¹
