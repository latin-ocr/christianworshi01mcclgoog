13. Tho danicae sacratorum}

One hook remsine to be described, which, like most ol
the ancient liturgioel manuscripts, hee received from its
original editor en incorreot title. This is tho Sacramen-
tariom Gallicorum of Mehillon. As the Mieeale coetuum
, end the Misoale Gallicanum ere thus designstcd, although
they ere not Missels, hut Seerementeries, eo the Socra-
mentarium Gallicanum beers this neme, although it is not
e Secrementsry, but e Missel. Mebillon found it et Bobbio,
end publiehed it in his Meeaeum Italicum? The menu-
ecript, which wes sent to St. Germein des Pres st the time
ol publication, hes remeined et Puris ever since. It is now
in the Bibliotheque Notionele (No. 13, 246). Mons. Dslisle
believes it to be s work of the seventh century.

In spite of its greet antiquicy, the Bohbio Missel is but
en indifferent source of informetion on the Gellioen use It
begins by e otissa Rooeeoscb cottidianum which the Romen
end Gallicen uses ere combined in e peculier leshion
Up to the Preieoe, ell the rituel is Gallicam from the
Prslece onwerds allis Romen This is followed by the
Messes end rituel ol the ecclesiasticel yser. The series
begins with three Messes io Adventum Domini, before
the Vigil ol Christmes. The Seints¹ Deys ere few in
number. Thereis eMess in honour of St. Sigismond
for those who ere suffering from the querten egue. Iu
sech Mese we find, first the text of the three Gellioen
lectione, then the four prayers before the Pteleos, end
finally the letter under the rubrio Ooeteetctio. Nono of
the Messes goes beyond the Sanctus, which imPlies thet
they ell termineted in the seme wey es the musa
senense cottidiano st the beginning of the Missel.
