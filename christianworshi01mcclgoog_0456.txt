other manner, eould only regain admission by the way of
penanoe. The drot step in that (1113311011 was the petition
for mhabilitation, that is to say, for admission into the
number of 1113 penitenta. It was not easily granted ; some·
times, even when it waa aooorded, the penitent was given

to understand that the expiation for hie fault must be
eontinued till the day of his death. It was never granted

whole time of hie penanoe the sinner had to live under
much 1113 same eonditions aa the professed ascetios. He
oould neither marry nor fulfil the conditione of a marriage

short, was that of a monh. The whole differente between
