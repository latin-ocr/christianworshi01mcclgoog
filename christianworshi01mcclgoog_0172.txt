This valuable manuscript beers the number 317 in
Quaen Christina’s collection in the Vatican. It came from

the Petau Library. From certain details which it contains?
we are able to ascertain that it was drawn up for the Church
of Autun. Tommesi, who was the first to edit it, and
Mabillon, who published it after him, were incorrect in
thinking that its procreavero was the province of Narbonne,
then subject to tho Visigothic kings. lhis opinion appears
to have been suggested to them by anote written in
the fifteenth century as a heading to the manuscript:
Miesalc Gothicam. We must also be cautious in accepting
Mabillon's opinion that it represents the parate ordo polli-
caece As a fact, this Sacramentary contains many Roman
alements.

Two Messes are missing at the beginning, to judge by
the numemtion of those which follow. The series, as it
stands, begins with the Mass for Ohristmas Eva. After the
Epipheny, we find certain Messes in honour of various saints,
then follow Lent and Eester, the festivals of the Invention
of the Holy Cross, of St. John the Evangelist, the Rogation
Days, the Ascension, and Whitauntide, and finally other
Messes in honour of saints, either special for certain festivals
or for the common of saints, and six Masses for Sundays.
