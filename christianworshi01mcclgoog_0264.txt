Verious endeavours were mede in various countries
to combine the Quadregesima with the Holy Weeh. At
Antioch end in the Ghurehes following this great eentre,
the two periods were more distinctly defined then else·
where. In one of his homilies⁹ St. chrysostom expresses
himself somewhet es follows: “We heve et length oome
to the end of Quedregesime, end we ere now about to
enter on the great week.” In the Apostofir Ooo-
etitutiorr also⁸ it ie formelly declared thet the feet of
Lent is finished when thet of the great paschal week
is begun. At Rome, on the other hond, end et Alexandria,
end even et Jerusalem* Holy Week wes included in
the Qusdregesime in such a manner thet the whole fest
lested only six weeks, but et Constantinople end in the
