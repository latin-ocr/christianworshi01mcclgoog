we could find it fully stated in some author.¹ Unfortu-
nately we know of no text containing it, and we are there·
fore compalled to put it forward as an hypothesis, but itis
an hypothesis which falls in with what we may call the
recognised methodo in such matters.

Ι will adduce, moreover, a coincidence which increases
its probability. Up to the present we have been dealing
only with the date of the 25th of December. That of the
6th of April still remains to be explained

Sozomen² makes mention of a sect of the Montauists
who celebrated Easter on the 6th of April in place of the
25th of March, because the world having been created at
the equinos, that is, according to their reokoning, on the
24th of March, the first full moon of the first month took
place fourteen days later, that is, on the ech of Aprile N ou,
between the 6th ol April and the bth of January there are
just nine months, the same interval as between the 25th
of March and the 25th of December. The Greek day for
the observanee ol the Nativity, the 6t110f J anuary, ia thus
found to be connected with a paschal computation, based
on astronomical and symbolical consideratione exaetly similar
to those from which we have endeavoured to deduce the
date of the 25th of December.

Itis possible, from what has preceded, that the date
