It is clear that the word anthem is nothing more
than a transformation of the term antiphona. I will use
tha word antham in its present significanco‚ hut to antiphae
I will apply its primitive sense, viz. that of a psalm sung
by two choirs, and with its initia] and final modulation.

We shall see hereaftcr that antiphons were used at
Rome, not only in offices other than the Mass, hut in
tha Mass itself‚ which admitted of two forms of it, the
antiphon od introitum and the antiphon od commonionem.

Whatever the form of psalmody might bc, it- was a
general custom, in the fourth century, for the psalm to
end with the doxology: Gloria Patri ct Filio at Spiritui
0011000, eiad erat ia principio et 11110 ct compca· ct io abacta
socosclorom. Actori}

As was the case with the formularies of prayers, the
musical portione ol the service were fixed at an early
date, and had places assigned to them according to the
days and feasts of the year. Hence arose the need of
special books. At Rome there were, besides the books
which were employed sor the day and night offices, two
distinct volumes for liturgical use, strictly so called, that
is, sor tho Mass. These were called respectively the
Cantatoriom² and Antiphooeoriom. The former was for

the uso ol the deacon (later cantore), who sang the
gradual and similar chants from the ambo. Tho other

was a chod-book, which was kept in the place in which
the schola cantorum was held. lt contained, beside the
two antiphone already mentioned, the other musical parts
of the Mass for every day in the year, namely the offertory,
the Obria io walaia, eto. As sar aethe antiphone were

ι’111111 is thc 1101101 formulary. The slight variatione in other uses
will bo noted elsewhere.
