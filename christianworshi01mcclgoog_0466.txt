imi Rhoohcmmow oi mimis. 445

Between this picture and the ritual of the Mommbio
Missal there is the difference which in matters of this
nature separatos the thixd century from the sixth. But
the exies of Induhjmtia which on Good Friday once rung
through the Ghurohes of the Visigothio kingdom are disectly
descended from the ories of pity which the persevering
faithful of old times raised, either spontaneously, or at the

exhortations of the bishop, when arepentant sinner oeme to
beg for readmission into the Chiistian assembly.
