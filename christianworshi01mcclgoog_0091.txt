The most characteristic feature of the liturgias of
Nestorian origin is the position assigned to the Great
Supplicetion, or Memento. Instead of following theEpiclcarc,
ae in the Syrien Liturgy, it is placed before, and imme-
diately connected with, the Commemoration ef Christ, or
Anamares.

The following are the texts which are at present known
of these liturgias.

1. An Aoopbora of the sixth century, first published
by Herr Bickcll¹ and, efter re-examinaticn of the manu-
script, by Mr. Hammond.² It is merely a fragment in
very bad preservation, but entitled to respect on account
of its antiquity.

2. sse liturgy of SS. Adaeus and Maris, founders of the
Churches of Edessa and Seleucia. This is the normal
liturgy of the Nestorisue, and the only one used by ihc
Ohaldean Uniata⁸

3. The two Acaplrorce of Theodora of Mopsuestia and

of Nestorius, which are used by the Nestorians at certain
times of the year-⁴

Nestorian tradition attributes the final fixing of the
liturgy in its curtailed form as found in the text attributed
to SS. Adaeus and Maris, to the Patriereh desuyab 111,

who lived about the beginning of the sevcnth centmy.⁶
