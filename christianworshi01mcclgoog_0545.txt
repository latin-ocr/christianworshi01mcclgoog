Tua “ Canens 01 Hippolytus ” are not known 1ο us in 1110011010111 Greek
text, but only through Arabio and Ethiopie 1100010110111 01 0000110
version 01 the Greek original. Moreover, these translations have reached
us only in manuscripts 01 the thirteenth century et earliest. The late
Μ’· Haneberg‚ Bishop 01 Spires, prepared the Latin version, which 1
give here. We 000 thus that there are several intermediaries between us
and the original text. There is reason 10 believe also 1110000111 11001
accidente 01 transcription and translation, we have more 11100 000 instance
01 interpolation. Taken as a whole, however, this collection 01 liturgieal
and disciplinary prescriptione belongs certainly 10 0 date anterior to the
fourth century, and there is nothing to binder us from assigning it to the
1101001 Hippolytus himself.

1 have thought it well to reproduce the tert here, although it has been
twice published, once by Haneberg, in 1810, and again by Herr Achelis,
10 1891.1 Τοο much attention cannot be given 10 00011 en important
document In the learned treatise which Achelis has prefixed 10 his
edition, he has discussed the majority 01 the questions which 1110 Chaone
of Hippolytus have raised, but there is still much te be done.

0 Herr Achelis has re·edited Haneberg's version, omitting 0 long homi·
letieal passage, which was evidently interpolated‚ and changing the order
01 1110 chapters. These are not arbitrary modificatione, but are based on
an ancient recension 01 the Canens 01 Hippolytus in the Oenone 110110
1110011001 of Egypt, 01 which we possess aCoptic version.⁸ The latter text,
which 10 01101 to the Apostolic constitutions, so long known to the world,
