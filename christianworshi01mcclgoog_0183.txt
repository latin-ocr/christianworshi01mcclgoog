for the stational Mass. The difference in place depended
on the character of the congregation. At the Messes cele·
brated in chapels, cemeteries, presbytera] churches, and even
in the great basilicas, thera were present, the statione] days

of association of the faithful, whether resident or pilgrimo.
The Mass aeid on auch occasions was a private Mass. The
public Mass, that is to say, the stational Mass, was that in
which the whole church was considered to take part.

study is the more importent. hs we find it described in
the Ordines of the eighth or ninth century, it implied u
ceremonial which corresponded more with the exigenciea

pontifical court, which had then reached a considerable
development, played in itan important part. 'The diflerent
classes of the clergy, ananged according ιο their orders
and to their regions, the corporation of cantors,thecn1cife1s
of the quarter, the military and civil rulers, and, in fact,
everybody, had his part in these high ceremoniale of wor-

has to do with this high ceremonial, and will confine myself

the Roman and other liturgica

The congregation of the faithful having asaembled, the
priests, accompanied by the bishops then in Rome, took
their places in the apse ol the church which was reserved for

the superior clergy. The pontiff and his deacons set out
from the secretarium, or sacristy (which was situated close
to the entrance ol the church), and proceeded to the altar.
