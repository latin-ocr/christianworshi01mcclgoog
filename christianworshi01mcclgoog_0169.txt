archdeacon was contrary to that fornished by the Ordo,
and poor Amalarius was obliged to ecknowledge that his
document was not without its shortcomings.¹

It does not, moreover, require a lengthy examination
to see that the paschal Ordo does not possess the Roman
characteristica of the Ordo of the Mass. In taking up the
latter, we leel ourselves transported to Rome, into the midst

oi the Roman clergy, to the city with its seven regions,
and its special days of service lor each region. The

officiating minister is the Pope himself, dcccco apostolicas,
who appears surrounded by the great dignitaries of his
court-the primiciarius, the scmradiccrics, the miccius,
the oomcwictm and others. He starts from his Palaoe oi
the Lateran and proceeds on horseback in procession to one
or other oi the Roman basilicas. Itis clearly impossible
to refer these details to any other locality. In the paschal
Ordo, on the contrary, there are no indicatione of any
particular town, while it is an ordinary dignitany-a bishop
-who officiatos, and sometimes even merely an inferior
ecclesiastic. The use is indeed Roman, but Roman as
observed elsewhere than in Rome, and combining with
incusans unknown to the papal court.

Itis therefore impossible to attach the same weight to
the paschal Ordo as to the rest. It contains, doubtless,
many Roman details, but details which in every case
require to be confirmed by more trustworthy documenta.

Among such documents is a fragment of a paschal Ordo
found by Signor de Rossi in the celebrated epigraphical
and topographical manuscript of Einsiedeln, and published

by him in vol. ii. of his Inscriptioacs tlarbtiaacc, p. 34
