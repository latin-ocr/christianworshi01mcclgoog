st. Germain is the only writer who mentions the
chanting ol the lhisugion as accompauying the pmcession
of the Gospel, both on going and returning. But in all
the Latin liturgias tha exclamation by the congregat-ion,

Gloria tihi Dmnim, is prescrihed aa the response to the

announcement of the Gospal lection: Lectio eoacti Evangelii
soetmdwm N.

5. aaa Homily.

GERMAIN: Homiliae cachat coactorum qaae legantur pro
eolo praecautione mulctet-ar, at quicquid Propheta, Apostolus
ael homeliam aeternavit, loc doctor vel postor Ecdeaiae
apertiora saracene populo praedicet, ita arte temperatae at ccc
metictas captate offendat, aec locata loquacitas abaciaco
mathie fiat.

Tha custom of having the Homily after the Gospel was
better observed in Gaul than in Rome. The priests, as
well as the bishops, were accustomed to preach. This
usage is denounced by Pope Galestine in a latter which
ha addressed to tha Bishops of Provence.¹ But instead
of being abolishad on that account, it was confirmed and
extended aven to rural parishes by the second Counoil of
Vaison (529). This enuncil was tha Provincial Counoil
of the Matmpolis of Arles‚ audit iswell known what a
zealous advocate of pieaching its hishop, st. Caesanius
of Arlas, was. His homilias have exectly the qualities
of olearness and simplicity which St. Genesin claims for
them.²
