§ 3.-Hothnn1c
Similar observatione may be made on the subject cf Holy

Week. The most ancient of its peculiur features is the
festivales Maundy Thursday, devoted to the solemn ccm-
memoraticn of the institution oi the Eucharist, to which was
added, at all events at Rome, the consecration oi holy oils
and the reconciliation of ponitents, ceremoniea‘which invest
it with the character of an immediate preparation lor the
Christian Easter. With the exceptiones the Thureday,
there are. no ancient Stations in Holy Week except those
of the Wednesday and Friday. Saturday never had, and
even now hes not, any Station assigned it, properly speaking,
since the present service for that day is merely the Eaater
Vigil anticipated. The liturgicel Stations for Monday and
Tuesday are certainly later than the time of St, Leo. It
was, in fact, the custom of this Pope to give a yearly
exposition cn the Passiones our Lcrd, and as it was im-
possible ior him tc do so in one sermon, he began on the
Sunday before Ecstor, and continued his exposition at the
Station cn Wednesday. Had thare boen any meetings

between the Sunday and the Wednesday, St. Leo would
not have waited till the latter day tc resume his discourse.

In the present service for Gcod Friday, if we except the
ceremonies connected with the Adoretion of the Crosa,
which are certainly not an essentie] port of it, and also the
Mass cf the Presanctified, we have the exact order of the
ancient Synaxes without a liturgy, namely, lectione alter-
nating with chants, and followedby prayers for all the
necessities cf the Ohurch The lectione are still three in
number, separated by two psalmi resperserit in the form of
the gradual and the tract.

Iam inclined to believe that the ancient service for
Wednesday in Holy Week was of exactly the same type,
