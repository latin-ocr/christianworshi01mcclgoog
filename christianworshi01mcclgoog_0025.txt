peculiar ιο a foreign nation, and it was necessary to become
a Jew in order to worship the god of the lewish people.
On the other hand, the Greeks for sometime pest had
combined a respect for the extemals of worship with the
greatest latitudo of opinion as ιο their efficaey, and even aa
ιο the nature of the gods. Philosophicsl speculation could
readily be pursued without abandoning the rational religion.
Such a state of things, however, was not very favourable, on
the whole, ιο the spread of szish belief among the true
Hellenie population. There is ground to think that the
szish propaganda obtained its chief success in another
directior, namely, among those subject peoples without home
cr country, who were legally incapable of citizenship, and for
whom union with the Jewish community meant a step
upwards politically, while at the same time their initiation
into the worship of God meant a step upwards spiritually.
However this may be, it is certain thet the Jewish
communities in the Emtae also in Graece, had attained a
considerable development by the time these countries were
transferred to the Roman rule. The Romans accepted the
situation and maintained and safeguarded the privileges
granted to the Jews by the Macedonian rulers. This orga-
nisation was part of the politioel machinery, and they were
cereful not to destrcy it. They refrained, however, from
importing it into the West. Tbere was no doubt a Jewish
colony in Rome, and that at a fairly early date; but it had
nc privileged position. More than once—under Tiberius in
A.n.19,and under Claudius in aa. 54-it was broken up,
and its members driven out of Italy. Rome, moreover,
was at thie period a semi-Greek city, and it was among its
Greek-speaking inhabitants that the Jews were ιο be found,
afaat which is evidenced by the exclusivsly Greek inscrip
tions on their tombs. The Jews never translated the

Scripturas into Latin. Tha influx of their nation into the
West is posterior to the early ages of Christianity.
