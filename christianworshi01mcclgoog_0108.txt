from Pmme, and that on this gruum the Roman Liturgy

alone has the primordial right to be the liturgy ef Latin
Christendom :-

Quia enim nesciet aut non advertat id quoda principe apostnlorum Petro
Romanae ecclesiae traditum est ae nunc usque custoditur ab omuibus
debere servari, nec superduci aut introduci aliquid quod auctoritatem non
babeat aut aliunde accipere videatur exemplum? Praesertim cum sit
manifestum iu omnem Italiam, Galliam, Hispanias, Africam, atque Siciliam
insulasque interjacentes nullum instituisse eeclesias, nisi eos quos venera-
bilis spostolus Petrus aut ejus successores constituerunt sacerdotes? Aut
legant si in his provinciis alius apostolorum invenitur aut legitur decuisse.
Quod ai non legunt, quia nusqirem inveniunt, oportet eoa hoc sequi quod
eeclesia Romam custodit, a qua eos principium accepisse non dubium
est.

However strange the fact may seem to us, it is none
the less certain that, from the time of Pope Innocentâ€š the
Roman liturgical use was not the only one followed in
the West, ereren in Italy itself. The bishop to whom the
letter, lrom which I have just quoted, was addressed was
Bishop of Eugubium, in the district of Umbria, which
belonged to the metropolitan diocese of the Pope. As en
immediate suffragan of the Pope hebed special reasons for
conforming to Roman customs, and notwithstanding this
he was tempted to introduce others. The practice of Romo
was thus attached in its own domuin.

, The letter belongs to the year 416. The liturgical
and disciplinal peculiarities which were therein found to
ba opposed to the Roman customs are all characteristic ef

the documenta which heve cume down te us bearirng on this ancient
Christian community agree in representing it aa being in close und
frequent relations with the Church of Reme. Thero ia nothing to prove
that its founder was from the l'rovince of Asia, rather thau a Roman.
Suppesing even that he was an natalie, it wris possibly the ease that
he had lived in the tirat instance at Rome, und had there received his
miseren.
