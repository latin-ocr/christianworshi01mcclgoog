principal instances, es I shall have to return to this subject
later on. At the end of the benediction of the sub-deacon
(Ι. 96) we find a formulary entitled obsecratio marcum,
whichis evidently out of place, for the consecration of
hands was never employed in the case of subdeacons. This
formulary, moreover, belongs to the rite of the ordination
of priests according to the Gallican use. It cannot pos·
sibly have been Roman. We know, indeed, from most
trustworthy documenta, that the consecration of hands
did not form part of the ordination ritas in use at
Rome. We ars here confronted, therefore, with aGallican
interpolation.

Thm is not an isolated instance. The whole of the ritual
of the minor orders, as it appears in sections I, 95, 96, of
the Gelasian Sacramentary, is Gallican from end to end.
It is headed by the rubria Incipit ordo dc sucus ordinibus
&educastis Next follows an instruction with regard to the
conditions of age, etc, for receiving orders, copied from the
decretal sent by Pope Zosimus to Hesychius of Salona.l
Then follow the first ten chapters of the Statura Bubasius
Acutique, as to the ordination or installation of bishops,
priests, deacons, sub-descons, acolytes, exorcista, readers,
doorkeepers‚ cantore, consecrated virgins. This deomant,
which is often assigned to the fourth Oouncil of Carthago,
is in reality a decree of Gallican origin, promulgated in the
province of Aries towards the end of the fifth century. The
whole of the above serves as a preface to the Bcracdictioacs
super cos qui sacris ordinibus benediccrulc' auct, bencdictione,
as we shall see later on, which were not in use at Remeat
all. The compiler who inserted this long excerpt, had before
him a Gallican text embracing all the various orders. As far
as the benedictione are concerned, he restricted himself to the
forms connected with the minor orders, those for the major
