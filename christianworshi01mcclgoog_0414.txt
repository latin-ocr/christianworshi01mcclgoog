are represented, we observes striking resemblance between
the two. To be convinoed of this, it is merely necessary
to glauce at the moenie which Ι have just mentioned, or
at the miniatures of the Tivoli wermonon. In the latter
we see grouped together the Pope, with his pallium over
his planeta, and the suburbicariae bishops, with their
stoles under the same vestment. Both stoles and pellicea
are ol exactly the same shape and colour, and are orna-
meuted with the same little black crosses. It is there·
fore quite conceivable that whoever wore one of these
two insignia might not wear the other.1

ln the end, however, a combination of the two was
affected. At Ravenna, where a love for decoratione was
always evinoed, we see in the mosaice os San Vitale, Bishop
Fcolesius (sixth century) wearing both the priestly stole
and the Romen palliam. This picture seems to be an
isolated instance,2 the other Bishops of Muenna, successore
of Ecclesiae, being represented with the palliam only.
Both are seen worn together in a Sacramentery of the ninth
century³ from Autun, and on the paliotto [altar covering] of
San Ambrogio of Milan; and such appears to have been the
custom thenoeforward among the Frankish clergy.

If we take these facts into consideration, and also the
differences and modificatione, we are thus led to traco the

history of the insignia known under the names pallium,
omophorion, orarium, stole, and epitrachelion. ΑΗ havea

common origin. They are distinguishing marks of dignity,

introduced into eeclesiastical use during the fourth century,
