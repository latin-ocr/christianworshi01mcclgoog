interval when it was restored under the Emperor Philippices
(711-713). It held its ground, however, at the convent of
John Maron, in the Lebanon, and within the radius of
influenee of this monastery. Hence the origin oi the
religione group ol the Maronites, who, after having main-
tained their dogmatic isolation for five hundred years, entered,
in 1182, into communion with the Roman Church-in a
eomewhat precarious fashion, it is true, for even up to the
end cf the sixteenth century the union was subject to oon·
siderable fluctuatione. The Maronites were gevemed from
their monastery, in whioha certain number of bishops resided.
After many efforts, success at length attended the attempt to
substitute sor this primitive organisation asort of eccle·
daeticd province, with dioceses and fixed episcopal scats.
The bishops recognised a patriarch as their head, who took
his title from Antioch. Syriae is the liturgieal language
of the Maronites, as it is of the Jacobites, both Uniats
and non-Uniate.l

Alongeide these national patriarcha, whose origin goes
back to the heretical schism, the official and orthodox
Patriaroh of Antioeh maintained his existence, although
numerous secessione had much enieebled his position.
His peculiar liturgy was gradually supplanted by that
of Constantinople, the only one which is now in use in
the Greek Oburehes of the Patrierohate oi Antioch. A

¹ The Maronia patriarchato is therefore quite a modern institution. Its
titular patriarche are in no respect the successore of the ancient Patriarcbs
oi Antiooh. This is not tho case, however, with regard to the Syrien
patriarcha, the Malohite patriarch, and the Greek non-Uniat patriarch.
'l'hese two last represent-with the differenee oi communion—the successise
ot the Greek orthodox patriarche oi Antioeh; the Syrien patriarcha, with
the same differenee, arc tha inheritors of the Jacobite patriarchal eea
founded in tha sixth century. Strictly speaking, there ought not to bo
in Syria another Catholie patriarch thau the Malohite. The existence of
the other two is due to tho respect with which tho hely see considers it
right to regard distinctions introduced centurias ego, whatever their
legitimeoy may hare been at their beginning.
