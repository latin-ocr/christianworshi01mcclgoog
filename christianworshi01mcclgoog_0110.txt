ΤΗΒ TWO LITURGICAL USES OF THE cmv WEST. 89

must not lose sight of the fact thet it has been for centurias
subject to continuone modification in the direction of bring·
ing it more and more into conformity with the Roman
nse. This movement suffered nc check from the discovery
of printing. Editions after editions of the Ambrosian Missal
became more and more Romanised. But the beginning of
this process goes back to some time before Oharlemagne.
It was natural that such should be the case, ior Milan
was too near Rome to escape from its influence in this
as in other respects. It adopted at an early date the
Gregorian Canon. In spite, however, of the many modifica-
tione it has experienced, the Ambrosian Liturgy preserves
sufficient Gallicae features to establish clearly its primitive
identity, in my opinion, at least, with the transalpina
liturgias.¹ The facts Ι intend to adduce later on will put
this in a clear light. I do not bring them forward here
because they would lose something of their significance
if Ι isolated them from the comparative analysis of the
Gallican rites3 but I think no one will regnet giving me
credit in the mean time.

¹1 ought in truth tc say that these viows have not been accepted
without reserva by the Miiancse experts who have taken up the study oi
the Ambrosian Liturgy. This difference of appreciation would have given
me more concern ii Idid not feel that it was connected with a teredenoy,
very natural and werthy of regard in other respecta, to exaggerate the
importunes ei this liturgy. It is not willingly admitted that the Ambrosian
rite has been subject to so much Roman revision, and that it is now very
iar irem its primitive form. 1 sear 1 have perhaps given offence iu pre·
aenting it as a combinetien, somewbat hybrid in character, oi the Rom
and the Gallicae. There is a tcndency to regard it ae not only relatively
pure, but that it preserves in it the ancient Latin rite, of which the
Roman is a degraded form. I cannot accept this view of the matter.
'l'his does not, however, prevent me from having a deep interest in the
Ambrosian Liturgy, and in its preservation and restoration. The Gallicae
Liturgy may bc purcr in the ancient books, but, like Roland's mare, which
had otherwise such excellent qualitics, it ie dead. At Milan, however
much it may have suffered in its many vicissitudes, it is still living. ln
this respect there is compensation for many desecte.
