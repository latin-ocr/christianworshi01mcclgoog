by the Po, in the Danubian provinces, in Gaul, Spain, and
Britain, whether owing to the fact that the cities in these
regions included a large extent of territory, or that it was
not thought advisable to place a bishop in each, the epis·
oopal areas were more extensive and numerically smaller.
This fact probably accounts sor the late grouping ol them
into provinces and assigning them metropolitana. In Nor-
thern Italy there was at first one metropolitan only, that of
Milan, whose jurisdiction extended over the whole diocese ol

Italy so called. Towards the beginning of the fifth century
this province was made into two by the formation oi the

metropolitan see of Aquileia. A little later the province of
Emilia furnished some suffiagans to the Bishop of Ravenna,
when this town became the Imperial residence. Ravenna,
however, was included within the area os the metropolitan
rule ol the Pope, and hence its bishop remained a suffragan
ol the Roman see, although he was himself metropolitan
ol the sees of the province of Emilia which had been
detached from that of Milan.

Britain and the Pannonian provinces were separated from
the Empine before the system of ecclesiastica] metropolitans
could be introduced into them respectively. At all events
there is no documentary evidence to the contrary. In
the fifth and sixth centurias, what remained of the Upper
Danubian provinces was divided between the two Italian
metropolitan sees of Milan and Aquileia Rhaetia Prima

(Ooire) was under the jurisdictiones Milan; Rhatta Secunda
(Augsburg‚ Seben), Noricum (liburnia), Pannonia Prima
(Scarbantia), formed part of the Council of Aquileia.l
