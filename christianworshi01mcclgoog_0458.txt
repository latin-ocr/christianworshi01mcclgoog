of the faithful, just as they hed been solemnly introduced
into it et the time of their baptismel initiation. There was
even e coincidence oi time in the two ceremonies. for both
took place immediately efter the Eester festival

But few traces heve come down ιο us from these early
times of the rituel in use ior the edmiesion ιο the number
of the penitents. It was necessary first to heve acknowledged
the loults for which the penancs was sought. We gether
from the life of St. Hilery oi Arles¹ (ι 447) thet the
bishop gave en eddress, leid his hands on the penitenti,
and recited a prayer. The Council oi Agde (506) also
mentions the imposition of hands,² tc which was edded

menteries on the subject, il we ere not bere confronted with a rituel
which is Gallican rather thau Romen. But this hypothesin is set uide
by the diction ol the prayers, end hy the mention ot' the Wednesdsy io

Sacramentum, was still characteristic of Βοωοο usage.
