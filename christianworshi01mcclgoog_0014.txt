be added a chronological one. As 1 did not
intend to treat of anything posterior to the eightb

century, Ihave been obliged to omit certain cere·
menies, some of them even of an imposing character,

which were not introduced until a later date, or of
which the ritusl bas come down ιο us in a form too
far removed from its primitive condition. I allude
especially to the ritca connected with the inaugura·
tion of sovereigus, an act of great importance,
whether viewed from the politieal or the religious
standpoint. In Franco this ceremony isuot older
than the accession of the Carlovingian kings, and if
we bave reason to believe that it was prectised some·
wbat earlier in the British Isles aud in Spain, there
is no document extant which enables us ιο gether
the details of the ceremony at that remote date
The various rituale for the consecration of the
emperors in the basilica of St. Peter at Roma have
been recently classified, but none orthem, in my
opinion, goes back even as lar as the uinth century.
Such is the scope of the present volume. Ι have
thought it necessary to define it, iu order that the
reader may not look for that which I was neither
capable nor desirous of including within its peges. It
merely remains for me ιο add that the work Ι set my·

sels to accomplish was that of the historiari, or perhaps
even of the autiquary, aud that Ι bad not the least
desire to protest against the changes introduced into
liturgieal usages in the course of centurias or by the
decisione of competent authorities. It is possible ιο
take an interest in the history of the Merovingians
