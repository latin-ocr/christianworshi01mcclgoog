ancient and most solemn representation of the Devidio
Psalter. We must take care not to put them on the seme
footing as the other chants, the Introit, Offertory, and Com·
munion, which were introduced later, and then merely to
occupy attention during long ceremonies. The gradual
and similar chants hed an intrinaic velue, and during the
time in which they were sung there was nothing else
going on.¹ This was the ancient chanting of the psalms,
which in the primitive (lhurch alterneted with the lections
from Holy Scripture.²

The prodam, as has been said, was so called because
it was sung at the gradere or ambo, where the lections
also were read. It was sung always by a single cantor,
and the office of the cheir was confined to talu'ng up the
final musical phraea⁸ The other chants were executed
ire plano by the ohoir, orariola coritarum. lt was also
customary, up to the time of St. Gregory, that the
gradum and its additions should he sung like the Gospel,

by deaoons only; and thie functiou had quite a special
importance in the ministry of that order. Mention of it
frequently occurs in epitaphs:

¹⁸ Psallere et in populis volcs' modulam propheto
ric meror· plebem Christi retinere mondos,''

says a bishop, explaining in this manner how the faithful,

ι’ St. 28an refers to this frequently. Cf. Polmgrsplu's dimissis,
ro.v. p.. .

2 We see from this what a heresy it is to replere these ohants hy orgen
wlff-The cheir-mles continue to prescriba this method of executing the
ending of the chent. 'rma practice is very inolent, for mention is made
of it in the Apotidisnl Cosmum: “Tit τοὺς τοῦ Aufili ψαλλέτω ὕμνους
xci d hoho τὰ &sponium temnentes '³ (ii 57). Of. above, pp. 113, 114.
