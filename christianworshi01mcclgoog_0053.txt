Gaul, Spain, and Britain are countries of which the limita
are clearly defined by nature. In the fourth century the
difference in tho degree of civilisation which possibly existed,
for instance, between Baetica and Spain, and between the
region of Narbonae and the Tres Gallica, had become con-
siderably less apparent. If the Roman Empire had lasted,
it is possible that Spenish, Gallie, aud British ecclesiastical
groups might have been formed, of which the centre would
have been determined by the convergence of tha lines of
administration. The ecclesiastical province of Aries, which
in no way corresponds with the civil province of Vienna,
took its origin in that way. But the Barbarian invasione,
and the redistribution which followed, put a stop to any
development on these lines, and the ecclesiastica] provinces
of Gaul and Spain remaiued independent of all superior
authority or organisation until they emerged at length
as tha two natioual Ohurches of the Visigoths aud the
Franks.

We must not, however, ignore the peculiar position
which Milan held, towards the end of the fourth century,
as a centre oi influeres which was felt more in Gaul than
elsewhere. For a short but important period it would thus
appear that the Western episcopata recognised a twofold
hegemony-that of the Pope and that of the Eishop of

and at Thessalonica, and he it was who was oommissioned
