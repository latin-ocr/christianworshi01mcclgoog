Aa for the festival ol the 24th of June, it appears to
have been of Westem origin, like that of the 25th of
December.1 The earliest witness to its observance is to
be found in the sermons of St. Augustine.l From the
middle of the fifth century onwards the existence of this
festival is attested in all our sources ol information as
to Western usages. lt appeared also at a very early date
at Constantinople and in the Byzantina East. Thera were,
Ἰ however, places in which the ancient festival of January
held its own against the innovatiom The Calendar cl
Teura, belonging to the sixth century, represents a kind
ef compromise; the Nalote cf St. John is still retained
in the month ol January, but the festival of June is also
adopted, and, strange to say, as the anniversary of the Passio
os the saint.

'l'he festivals ol the Blessed Virgin, as they are now
observed both in the Latin and Greek Charches, have a
different origin 'anda different history from that ol the
primitive commemoration which I have just dealt with.

The most ancient oi these is that ol the Prcsentation

ol Ohrist in the Temple, which is generally called in χ
the West the festival of the Purification cf the Blesaed

precisely indicating the date. The genuine Roman books have no mentiones
this festival: its appearance in tha Gelasian Sacramentary is an indication
ef one cl the many revisious by Gallicam hands to which this collection has
been sabjected.

¹ It is to be noted that the festival ia on the aeth, aad not the aeth
of June; and we may well ask why the latter ligure was not adopted, since
it would have mvsa the exact interval oi six months between the Baptist
and Christ. 'l'he reason is that tbe calculaticn was made according to
the Reman (islanden the alth ol June la the etit. tat. ja, just as the aeth
oi December is etit. tot. joa. At Antioch‚ where the calculation was made,
trem the beginning to the end oi the maath the aeth would undoubtedly
have been chosen.

¹ Seras. 196 and 287. It is not to be found in either the Philocalian
Calendar, or in that of Polemias Silvius (448). Owing to the present con-
dition ot' the Syriae monologion, wc munet say whether it was there cr not.
