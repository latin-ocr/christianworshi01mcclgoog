The Ordo of the stational Mass, in the state in which
it has como down to us, is certainly later than tha time
of St. Gregory. We find in it several directions which
we know to have been introduced by him. For instance,
in the Pope's escort defendere of tha regions are
mentioned, dignitaries whose office was created by St.
Gregory;² the gradual is sung by a cantor, and not
hya deacon, in conformity with the rulo laid down hy
the Roman Gonncil of 595; the Pater Noster is placed
before the Pae Domini, an alteration whioh St. Gregory
himself states that ho mada⁸ It would not, however, he
correct to affirm that the whole of the ritual goes back
to tha time of St. Gregory and to tha beginning of the
seventh century. The mention of the deaconries, the
designation of the Palace of the Lateran hy the name of
Potrc'arcta'om,⁴ the marked development of the popel
court-all point to the later part of the seventh century.
Moreover, we have the mention of the Ayaua Dei, and this
hymnis known to have been introduced hy Pope Sergius
(687-701).15 It is therefore quito to the end of the seventh,
if not to the following century, that I should assign the
redaction of the Ordo, as wa possess it. Indead, we must
give even a later date, ifwe are to include some of the
supplements, for in one of these (o. 24) wa find the name
of Charlemagne, and a reference to the time (already past)
of the pontificata of Adrion. If we take into consideration
this additional pe1t,tha Ordo mnnot be earlier than 795.
