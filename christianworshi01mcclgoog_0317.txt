The insufflation, with a formulary of exorcism;

The signing with the cross on the forehecd;

The administering of salt.

The convert presente himself before the priest, who,
after blowing in his face,l marks him on the forehsed
with the sign of the cross, saying, Ia nemim Patris et
Filii ef Spiritus saucii. This ceremony is followed by a
prayer, which the priest recites, holding his hand extended
over the candidate :²

Omnipotens, sempiterne Deus, Pater domini nostri Jesus Christi,
respicere dignare super hunc famulum tuum quemad rudimenta fidei
vocare dignatus es Omnem caecitatem cordis sb eo expelle; disnrmpe
omnes loqueos Satanae quibus fueret conligatus. Aperi ci, Domine,
januam pietatis triae, et signo sapientiae tuae imbutus omniurn cupidita
urm foetoribus careat, et suavi odore praeceptorum tuorum laetus tibi in
Ecclesia deserviat, et proficiat de dic in diem, ut idoneus efficietur
accedere sd mabam baptismi tui, percepta medicina.

singular for the plural number. 'l'he two other formularies which follow
this prayer seem tc be variants This prayer is also found in the Gregorius
Sacramentary, p. 60 (humen), but it is incomplete towards the end.
Besidc the rituel given in i 30-32, the Gelesisn Secmmentary furnlshes
another, i. 71, which hss supplied much cf the material cf the ritunl
of the present day. I think, however, that this second ritusl is Gallicam,
with the exception cf the sdmiuistming cf the salt, which is decidedly
Roman, but which is accompenlsd in this cnse by no formulsry. 'l'hs
formularies i. 71, cr something like them, ere found in the nieme
