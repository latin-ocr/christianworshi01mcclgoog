The Canon having corne to an end, the Pater noster
follows. According to universal custom, it hes ashort
introductory preface, and at the end an elaboration of the
last petition (Libera nos).

Before the time of St. Gregory, the fraction of the
bread followed immediately upon the Cenon. It was
he who transferred the Pater noster to this place, on the
ground that it was hardly proper that the formulary
of the Canon, the work of some unknown scholar,
should alone be recited over the oblation, to the exclusion
of the prayer composed by our Lord Himself.¹ This
transposition, although st. Gregory defends himself from
the accusation of having followed any authority in intro·
ducing it, had the effect of bringing the Roman use into
conformity with that of Constantinople.

The ceremony which follows is seemingly complicated.
It begins with the kias of peace, which is placed imme·
diately after the salutation, Pae Domini sit semper
uobiscum. The Pope places in the chalice the fragment
of consecrated breed which had been brought to him at
the beginning of the Mass ; ha then breaks one of hia own

two oblatae, and places one half of it upon the altar.
We have not yet come to the fraction of the breed,
properly speaking, butas all the loaves upon the altar

¹Ep. in 12 (26): “Orationem vero dominicam idcirco mox post
precem dicimus, quia mos apstolorum fuit nt ad ipsam solummodo
orationem oblationis hostiam consecrarent. Et valde mihi inconveniens
risum est ut procem quarn scholasticus composuerat super oblationem
diceremus, et ipsam traditionem quarn Redemptor noster composuit super
ejus corpus ot sanguinem non diceremus. Sed et dominica oratio apud
Graecos ab omni populo dicitur, apud nos vero a solo sacerdote? We are
not obliged to believe, in spite of the authority of this text, that the
Apoealio Liturgy know of no other formulary but the Pater awaus, but
it is difficolt to argue against St. Gregory’a having thought so.
