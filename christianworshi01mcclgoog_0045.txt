the East between eeclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. Oves
the governors of provinces Diocletian had established rulers of
dioceses, or vicars. in the eastern division of the Empire these
dioceses were at first four in number-those of the Orient, of
Pontus, of Asia, and of Thrace. About the time of Tbeo·
