In the East there were festivals of St. Philip the Apostle
and St. James the Deacon, but these have no connection
with the festivals previously mentioned.

The festival of St Andrew (November 30) was of much
greater importance, and was more widely celebrated It
occurs on this day in all the calendars from the sixth
century onwards.¹ It isdifficult to traca out its origin,
or at least to suppose, as would seem to follow from the
celebrated letter (apocryphal) on the martyrdom of the
apostle, that this was the day of his festival at Patras.
In any case, this was not the day on which his translation
was observed at Constantinople (March 3), neither was it
that of the second dedication of the ehurch of the Holy
Apostles in this city (Jnly 28), nor of thet of the dedi·
cation of the first ohurch consecrated to him at Rome
(November 3))-

Whatever may have been the dignity of the individuale
in whose honour the immovable festivals of which 1 bave
just been writing were instituted, these festivals, without
exception, yield in point of antiquity to the anniversarios
of the martyra. The latter go back to the second century.
The anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp († 155)
was instituted at Smyrna immediately after his death⁸
I could not instance, in the case of Rome, a commemoration
as ancient. It is a remarkable thing even that the martyre
of the second century at Rome-I mean genuine martyrs,

Gallican liturgical books and in the Byzantina Calendar, ete.
