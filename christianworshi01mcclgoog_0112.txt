THE TWO musclcsu USES OF ‘l'llE LA'l'lN WES'I'. 91

Treves, Vienna, and Arles had passed away. The Bishop of
Lyons, whatever may have been his importunes in the second
century, occupied no special „prominence after Constantine.
He was scarcely more thsn metropolitan of Lvydukusis
Prima until the time of Gregory VII, who was the founder
of the primacy of Lycus, inetl'ective as it was. It was
not in conditione such as these that this Church could
become the model of all Westem Churches, the focus of an
ecelesiastical radiation sufficiently intense to make itself felt
beyond the Pyrenees and the English Channel, and, crossing
the Alps, strong enough to withdraw from the area of Romen
influence half the Ohurches of Italy.¹

It is manifest that another solution of the question must
be sought ior. The solution I have to offer is based on the
assumption that Milan was the principal centre of this

development.²
Ι have shown above that the Chureh of Milan had been,

¹ I am well acquaintod with thc feet that, towards tbc end of tho
sixth century, the Bishop of Lycus seems ιο heve put forwerda elsim to
suprameey over the Bishops cf Gontran's kingdom. Gregory of 'lours
(Hos. manc, v. 20) gives the title of patriarch to st. Niuier. His
samem, Priscus, beers the sume designation in the national council of
585. He cren brings about the decision there that the national couneils
shall be held every three years, he and the king convoking them. 'l'lse
Bishcp of Lyons is the first to sign in the couneils of Paris (614), (tlichy
(627), and cf chalonamsacne (alsout 650). In the years 597 aud 692 hc

umis Gouls, vol. i. p, 138. Βοι this ιιοιο of affairs has no emt of
relation ιο thet which obtained οι the beginning, in the time cf Pothinus
and ireneus. 'I'he history of St. Avitus of Vienna ond that cf the Vieariat
of Artes are sufficient to prove this.

¹ We might, in this connection, think of Arles, which enjoyed such
a very high ecclesiastieal position in the fifth and sixth centuries. But
this position was attained too late. It was ιο the fourth, and not to the
fifth or sixth, century that the liturgieal influcnee belonged of which

of ecelesiastica} law in Gaul. Ι have shown (Foster lfpisc, vol. i. p. 141)
that almost ell the turs· &amiam in use in Merovingian Gaul were derived
from those of the Ohurch of Arles. In segurd to the liturgy the mutter
was different. Arles was not cl sufficient importunes οι the time when the
Churchce of Gaul felt the necessity of regulating the order of worship.
