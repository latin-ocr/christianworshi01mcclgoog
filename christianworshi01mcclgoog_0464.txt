prostrate themselves and invoke the Divine mercy. The
formularies preserved closely resemble that of the Mrssa
pertinerint in the liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutione.

The archdescon, then addressing the assembly, both
clergy and laity‚ calls upon them to cry out, Indulgentiae!1
When these eries heve cenred, the archdeacon directe the
minda of all present to the “Good Shepherd who giveth
Hie life for the sheep‚” and then invitas them to unite
in prayer. The bishop then begins s kind of rhythmieal
litany, to which the congregation respond by fresh ories of
Indolqrrttr'a!

'l'e precemur, Domine,-Indnlgential
Procedst ab ditissimo-Indulgentiel
Succurrat nobis miseris—Indulgentisl
Delicta purget omnibus—Indulgential
Praestatur paenitentrlrus-Indnlgeutiai
- Patrona eit lugentibus-Indulgential
Errantes fide corrigat-Indulgential
Lapsae peccatis erigat-Indulgential
Te deprecamur, Domine‚-Indulgential

A prayer in the form of a collect follows, pronounced by
the bishop in the name of all present, in which he sppeals
to the Divino mercy in favour of the penitents.

The ories of Indulgentiae ariae afreeh, followed by the
litany, and the bishop’s prayer, with other formularies‚
but in the same order. This series being terminated, itis
taken up a third time; but at the end of the latter the
final prayer is omitted, and the service is continued by the

Adoration of tha Oroes snd the Mass of the Presanctified,
much aa in the present use.

¹ The rubrio of the present Morarabio Missal takes for granted that
these eries are regulated, and not spontaneomr the drat time they are not
to be repeated more than three hundred times; the second, not more thau
two hundred: and the third, not more thau oue hundred times.
