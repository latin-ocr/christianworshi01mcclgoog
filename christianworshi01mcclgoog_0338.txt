The ritual of the catechumenete consisted of three
ceremonies-exorcism, unction, und insufflation.

Exoreismis mentioned by Isidore und Ildefonsus. One
rather euricus formulary, preserved in the Misenis Galli-
ccncm, probably refers tc this ceremony ¹:

Adgredfor te, immundissime, demuste spiritus, eto.

The unction, mentioned also by Spanish writers, is
specially that of the eers und mouth. In this respect it
corresponds to the Roman Effcto, but it was also applied
to other parts of the body, andin this case it corresponds to
the unction of the breast and shoulders, which, in the Roman
rite, follows immediately after the Efflto. We have here, then,
at the very beginning of the catechumenate, the ceremony

which, according to the Romen use, terminates that period
of probation, and immediately precedes the renunciation of
the devii.² Finally, this anointing is soccmpanied by the

¹ et. Isidore, De Off, ii. 21, adds to cxoroiem the administration of salt:
“Exomizcntur, deinde seles accipiunt et unguntur.” But this ceremony
wss not universal in spalmus ildefonsus (De coquit. baptismi, 26) says it
wne observcd in some places, bnt that he disapproved of the onstom. lt
wne used, perhaps, in tho province of Boeticu, end was a vestigo of the
Roman nse, which in that country hod preceded the Gallicas.

²St. Ildofousus mentions the unction ss immediately following the
croroism (op. cit, c. 21, 27, 28). He refers the origin of this custcm to
the heeling of tho deaf and dnmb by the Epiphania and the encinting with
the salise, citing in support St. Mark vii. 32, 333 he suys eleo thet this
passage from the Gospel was read at the Mass during which the exorcism
took place. All this shows that it is clearly the Gallicen Effera which is
in question. The samo writer, indeed, specifice (c. 29) that “ pret exorcismus
tangimtur auriculae oleo. . . tangitur et os,” end all this before the
traditio of the Oreed, ot the moment when from being pectilia the person
become catechumenus.
