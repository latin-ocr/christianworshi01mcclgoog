The ceremony 01 4110 Indulgence is easily separated 11011
the other parte 01 4110 service. It comprises three acts:
4110 prayer 01 41101101140110 themselves, 4110 interessent
01 the congregation in their favour, the prayer addressed

in his own person by 4110 bishop 40 the Divina mercy. Tha
liturgical books do not distinguieh clearly between the
penitents and the general body 01 the congregation. At
4110 opening 01 the service every one² appears 40 be in
the position 01 0 penitent; but, later on, in that of an
intercessor. But the 110140 must be distinguished if we
wish to trace back this ritual 40 140 primitive meaning.
In early times the penitent could not reenter the com·
munity 01 the faithful without their expressed consent
When it was not spontaneously manifested, it was the office
01 the bishop 40 evoke it. The scene is described in 0
passage 01 ’10141111011 narrating the procedure 01 Popc
Oallixtus at the reconciliation 01 0 1011014014 011101-

“Thou dost usher into the church the penitent adulterer,
who comes to petition the assembly 01 the faithful, Behold
him, clad iu a hair-shirt, covered with ashes, in germents
01 mourning such as 40 excite horror. He prostrates him·
0011 in 4110 midst 01 the congregation, before the widows,
before the priests. He lays hold on the hem 01 their
garments, he kisses their footprints, he 0100110 them by the
knees. Meanwhile, thou dost address the people, thou dost
excite public pity for the sad lot 01 the supplinnt Good
shepherd, blessed Popc, thou dost relate the par-able 01 the
1004 sheep, that they may bring thee back thy wandering
she-goat;⁸ thou dost promise that it shall 1011010 escape
11011 the flock,” etc.
