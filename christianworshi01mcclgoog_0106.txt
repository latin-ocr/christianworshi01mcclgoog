lixed in famularia} One of them was said at the moment
at which tha veil was withdrawn. There was in facta
veil which, strawbing across the alter, or even across the
whole apae, shut out the view up to the moment when,

aster the dismissa] of the catechumena and other non-
communicante, the celebration of tha mysteries in the
presence of the initiated only was began. This weil is
still in use among the Charches following the Oriental rite.
It is stratched before the central door of the iconostasis;
and is drawn and withdrawn at the times enjoined in
the ancient liturgias.

We must take note of the recitation of the diptycha
in this part of the Mass. The Syro-Byzantina liturgias
place it between the Kisa of Peace and the Preface, and
this custom is corroborated, attha beginning of the sixth
century, by Dionysius the Areopagite. It disappeared after-
warda at Constantinople. In the Alexandrina nse, the
reading appears to have taken place, es it did in the Gallican
rite, after the Kisa of Peace.

From the saraam Corda until the end of the Mass the

ritas, and subjectmatter of the prayers, have remained almost
the sameas they were at the beginning. Some diversitias,
when we compare one use with another, appear in the
position assigned to certain parts, such aa tha Memento, the
Pater Noster, and the fraction of the breed, but hardly
any addition has been mede to the primitive ritual. It
is necessary to draw attention, however, to the complica-
tion introduced in the ceremony of the fractio, and of the
ammalario, that is to say, the mixture of the consecrated
breed and wine. A characteristic feature of the Litargy
oi Constantinople was the infusion of a little hot water
into the chalice immediately before the communion.

¹Dionysins the Areopagite makes mention of the prayer said by
the bishop at the moment when the sacred oblatione were placed upon
the aliar: this is the dvxh τῆς sponsalitiis: ol' the Byzantina Litargy‚ the
eonntarpart of the prayer saper oblata in the Roman hitnrgy.
