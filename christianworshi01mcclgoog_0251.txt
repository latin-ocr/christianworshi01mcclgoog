The two stational days were also marked by meet-
ings for worship. But these were held in different
manners in different localities. ln some placas the
liturgy properly so called was used, that is, the Eucharist
was celebrated. This was the custom in Africa in the
time of Tertullian,¹ and at Jerusalem towards the end of
the fourth century. In the Churoh of Alexandria, on
the other haud, the Station did not include the liturgy.
Socrates tells us that on these days “ the Scripturas were
read and were intorpreted by the doctors ; in short, all was
done as in the Synaxes, except the celebration of the
Mysteries.”² Ι believe that on this point, as on many
others, the use at Rome was similar to that at Alexandria
Itis certain, at least, that about the beginning of the fifth
century, the celebratior of the Mysteries (Βαονοοιοοιο) did
not take place at Rome on Fridays. Thereis no record as
to what took place on Wednesdays.³

Saturday, oi which the observante had at first fallen into

desuetude, was later cn assigned a special place. In the
East, during the fourth century, it was a day of Synaxes‚⁴

It will ba seen that Saturday in tha Ember Days has uo special Mass
assigned to it.
