The Kyric olomeo may be considered as a remnant of
the Litany form of prayer, or dialogue between one of the
sacred ministare and the whole congregation. This form
of prayer occupies, as we have seen,a prominent place in
the Greek liturgias. The Iiturgry of Constantinople, for
instance, contains a litany to be said at the beginning of the
Mass, before the entry oi the celebrants. It would appear
also that at Rome, in early times, it formed the initial
portion of the Liturgy. It was customary in the eighth

century on the Litany days, that is, the days on which
the people went in general proceesion to the ohurch of the
station, to sing neither Kyrie nor cloia. The service
at the ohurch began direotly with the Pus vobis and the

first prayer. Tne Kyric, in like manner, tras omitted on

the days appointed for ordinatione, because on such ocea-
sions the Litany was sung after the gradual. Even at

the present time the Kyrte claime in the Mass for Eester
Eve is nothing more than the conclusion of the Litany
with which thet Mass commenced.¹ St. Gregory² is
the authority for the statement that in his time the words
’ Kyric eleison and Chresto elersen were accompanied, except
in the daily Messes, by other formularies. These formu·
laries were, doubtless, alitany more or less elaborated
