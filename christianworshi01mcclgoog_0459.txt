On the Wedneeday¹ ic capta jejunii, which we now
call Aeh Wedneeday? the penitent presented himself be·
fore the prieet in the early morning, that ie, before the
procession to the stational Mene, and received from him
a hair-ehirt, in which he wae clothed during the recitcl of
a prayer, the text oi which ie not given. Thie ie in
the main the earne oerernony ae that prescribed by the
Gouncil of Agde. There ic no reaeon to doubt that in
Rome this ceremony may not have been in use much
earlier than the seventh century. The more medem
clement in it ie the choice of Aah Wedneeday lor ite
performance, and aleo the seclusion of the penitent in
e monastery. Ae late aa the middle of the fifth century
the penitente at Rome were left to themselves, and were
neither eecluded nor subjected to official supervision.⁸

The custom oi seclusion naturally obviatcd the eclemn
diemieeal of the penitente (caiam poenitentium) at the
public Mese. The Lotin Sacramentariee have preserved
no vestigo oi this usage, but in the Greek books, and
