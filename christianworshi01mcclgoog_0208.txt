archdeaeon, following the Pope, and the other deacons
following the bishops and priests, administer the chalice.
As 1110 Pope’s chalioe is used only for communicating the

higher clergy, the archdeecon takes care to pour, beforehand,
into the vessels containing the consecrated wine for the

communion of the people, some drops from that used by

the Pope, and, afterwards, what remains in it after the

communion 01 the bishops, priests, and deceons. By this it
is intended to show, that, although all do not touch with

their lips the same vassei, yet they all drink the sarno
spiritual drink. The rite of the 0010111111110,11011111,1 been
performed by 1110 Pope in the principa] chalice,is repeated
by the bishops and priests in all the other chalices, from
which the faithful are communicated under the species
of wine.

Before the communion of the people, the archdeacon
announces the day and place of the next Station. There
swas an object in choosing this moment 101 the announcement.
These who did not communicate were, doubtless, accustomed
to go out before the communion began. While the faithful
were communicating, the cheir chanted the antiphon ad
001101110ὼο00, At present itis chanted 01101 communion,
and is restricted to the antlrern [οι-1111011110, see p. 115], which
is sung only once. But the liturgical books of the ninth
century 01111 presuppose here arccl antiphon, the psalm
being chanted either in its entirety, or in pant, according as
the time occupied in the communion is long 01 short. It
was terminated by the doxology Gloria Patri, 010, and the
antiphon [0111101100] was repeated. This chant, like that of
the offertory, must go back 10 somewhere about the end of
the fourth century.¹

The communion having ended, the pope returns to the
alter, and salutes the congregation, inviting them 10 join
