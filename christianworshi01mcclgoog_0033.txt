that the documenta of the fourth and fifth centurias allord
ground for belief that the bishop had a share in the govern-

ment of the city. It is not only impossible to demonstrate,
but absolutely incompatible with the ecelesiastical law of
the period with which we are dealing, that the clergy were
identified with the ouria, and that the bishop‚ under the title
of defensor civitatis, took his place among the municipal

In one respect only, and that an important one, the
administrativa organisation of the Empire exercised a
real influence on the development of ecelesiastioal insti-
tutions. I refer to the areas of jurisdiction‚ municipal,
provincial, or otherwise.

At the outset no question had been raised with regard to

towns, and this was also the case with regard to the early
Christian communities. As Christianity spread into the
smaller towns and the country districts, it became necessary
to know where the territory of each Church began and where
it ended. The oities of the Empire, with their territorias
clearly marked out by the census, here presented limits
already defined, against which no reason os a religious nature

should have its own bishop‚ and that its population should eon·
stitute a Churoh by itself. These areas, it is true, were very
unequal. In some countries they were really provinces, as,
for instance, Poitiers, Bourges, and many others in Gaul. In

Africa, on the other hand, in Southem Italy, and in Western
