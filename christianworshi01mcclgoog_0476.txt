Tan manuscript of the ninth century (Parieiaue 974), from which
I have taken these texte, contains the following treatisee of
St. Augustino: De libero arbitrio et qratia Dei libri H.,· Altereotio
Felieioni orriaru' et beati Augustini, later I.; De praedestinatione,
liber 1. The proveaaaee of the manuscript is St. Amand en

Puelle, aa ie shown by the following note, written at the end:
Almae eeclesiae eonati Amondi in Pabula leher. Before and after
the text of St. Augustino, a few blank eheete remained, and
advantage was taken of theee for transcribing the Ordioee.
These aro drawn up in vulgar Latin (oon grammatino
aarum), which would, if the writer were a Frankieh clerk, melre
them of a date anterior to 800 or thereaboute. If it were a
Roman olerlr who transcribed them, then the dete might be
rather later. The manneoriptinoertainly not an original. Itie
a oopy from an original whieh was full of abbreviatione, all of
which have not been deoiphered by the oopyiet with equal skill-
Ireproduee it aa it etande, with the exeeption of a few manifest

of the manrueript ie given at the bottom of the page.
