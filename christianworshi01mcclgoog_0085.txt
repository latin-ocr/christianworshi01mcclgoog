The Liturgy of the Apostolic amartetes cannot bc
considered as the normal and official Liturgy of any distinct
Ohmch. It can be proved that its formularies did not
pms into the texts adopted later on es the Official Use. But
iifrom the point of view of its purport, it cannot be con·
sidered more than a private composition, itis otherwise with
the ritual which it impliee, and with the arrangement of the
prayers, their style and general tenor. In regerd to these,
we must recognise in itan exact representation of the use ol
the great Ghurches of Syria, Antioch, Laodicea, Tyre, Caesarea,
and J enrsnlem. The most trustworthy documento, in thet
which concems Antioch and Jerusalem, lurnish us here with
completely conwinoing evidence. Among these documents
we must not only assign a place to the texts of St. Cyn] ol
Jerusalem and of St. John Chrysostom, but we must also
take into our rechoning the Syrien liturgias of later
centuries, All these are, indeed, of the seme type as the
Liturgy of the Constitutione, ellowance being made, as a
matteras course, ior the additions and the greater com·
plexity oi the rites and prayers which have been incor-
porated into it in the course oi time.

ruis brings me to speak of the area in which the Syrien
Litmgy was used, ol its spread, to a varying extent, through-
out the whole East, Egypt exeeptcd, and finally of the
documenta containing it.
