There was no order anywhere‚ nothing but the most
complete anarohy-a lawless state of affairs which would
have been irremediable if the Carlovingian monarcha had
made nc appeal to tradition and to the authority of the
Roman Church.

The intervention ol Rome in the reformation of the
liturgy was neither spontaneous nor very active. The
Popes contented themselves with sending copies of their
