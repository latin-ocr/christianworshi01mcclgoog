of the saints given are few in number, that of St. Genevibve

Among the most valuable documents for the study of
the Gallican Iiturgy, we must include two letters published
by Martene² from a manuscript at Autun. The first bears
as its title the words Gamerae episcopas Parisios scripsit
da masa. I do not believe that there is the slightest
reason tc doubt the authenticity of this heading. St.
Germain of Paris, who flourished from 555-576, is well
1mown³ lor the zeel he displayed for the worthy celebra·
tion of the divine Service, and it is therefore not sur-

few peges to the symbolical meaning of the ritual of the
liturgy. This is, in fact, the subject dealt with in the
two letters. The first deals with the Mass, the second
with cemain particular details, ceremonies for special
occasions, and liturgica] vestments. In order ιο explain
the ritual, the venerable author is obliged ιο give a summery
description of it, and in this lies the peculier interest for
us of his explanation ,⁴
