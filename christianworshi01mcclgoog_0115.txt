94 cumarum WORSHIP: lus ORIGIN AND uvonussou.

many customs established which did not all seem to mquire
correction. lt is supposed that, doctrine being safeguarded by
the very fact of his elevation ιο the see of Milan, Ambrose
thought it inopportune to introduce useless changes in the
domuin of ritual. It is certain that many of tha most
important Milanese peculiarities‚ from the point of view of
discipline and worship, go back to his episcopate and, seeing
that these peculiarities have a distinctly Oriental character,
they could not have been introduced by him. It is more
natural to believe that they existed before him, and that
he had only sanctioned by his acceptence and practice
cnatoms previously imported.¹

Ido not wish to be dogmatic on this point. Milan was
in easy communication with Constantinople and Asia Minor
through Aquileia and the Illyrian provinces. Auxentius
was not the only Greek who in the fourth century may
have exercised episcopal functions in a Latin country. His
action in the liturgical domain may have been but an
cpisode in a larger movement. Others might have acted
ns he did in taking suggestions from the same models.
Neverthelass‚ as far aa Gaul and Spain are concerned, it
is very difficult ιο regard the development noted in these
countries as having proceeded from a Latin source further
removed than Milan.l

¹ Το those who arc sentimentally disinclined to accept a system which
would seem ιο ascribo an Arion origin ιο the Gallican Litmgy, I would
say that Arinniam bas nothing to do with tho question, which is ooncerucd
urlely with tha Oriental form of the liturgy‚u form of earlier dato than
Arianism in the countries ol its origin. 1 would add that, inaamnch as
forms of prayer were in the fourth century mueh varied und very easily
modifled. it munt be considered certain that St. Ambrooe would have left
nothing in thern which could possibly have intend heresy. The liturgy
ol tho Apostolic Constitutione is of the rame date and procerum. lt
presente evidcnt traces of theologicol speculatione, which wcrc currant
iu the region from which Arianism reoruited ita chief defendero.

² Thia does not exclude the direct importationa of certain Byzantina,
and especially Palestinien‚ usages. I shall have ιο point out several
instnuees of thia kind.
