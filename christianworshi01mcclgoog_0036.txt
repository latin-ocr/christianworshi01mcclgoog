10000000 the subject of legend. Rome, the capital 01 the Empire,
the see 01 St. Peter, a place hallowed hythe apostles, became
the uncontested metropolis 01 the Ghnrch. The Eastarns
themselves, in spite 01 the long sojonrn in their midst 01 the
Apostle John, recognised the 1001 without raising eny obstacle.
At the end of the first century, the Roman Ghurch‚ by the
mouthpiecs of Clamant, intervened with imposing authority
in the internal 00011010 01 the Ohurch 01 Corinth, which was,
however, equally 01 apostolic foundation. Hermas, shortly
after, wrote his Pastor for 011 the Churches3 and ignatius, the
Martyr Bishop 01 Antioch, calls 0110011οο 10 the prs-eminence

which had 110 seat at Rome, was, however, 0000010001 without
any thought 01 organising a special staff 01 01101010. Ι1 was
with the aid 01 the priests, deacons, and secretarios (0010011)
01 his Ohurch, that the Bishop 01 Rome dealt with the affairs
that came before him, or attandedtothe temporal and spiritual
needs 01 the Ohurohes which he deamed it incumbent on him
to essist.

Among the latter, the communities 01 Seuthem Italy,
already very numerous in the third century,¹ were bound by
