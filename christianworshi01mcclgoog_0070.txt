However frequently these Divina phenomena might occur,
they were not on that account the less extraordinary, and
it is impossible to regard them, properly speaking, ss a
religione institution. Neithcr the Christian communities
nor their pastore were able to produce them or to obtain
them at will. It was very difficolt even to regulata them,
ae we see from the history ol St. Paul and the Church at

Corinth. Moreover, they soon disappeared, and from the
beginning oi the second century onwards we find only
exceptional and isolated metanoea oi them. The only per·
manent clement, on the whole, which Christianity added to
the liturgy ol the synagogae was thus the sacred meal
instituted by J esus Christ ss a perpetual commemoration of
Himself.

The details oi this august ceremony are furnished by
the synoptic Gospsls, and by the passage in which St. Paul
treats oi the Last Supper. We have, first of oll, the aet of
thanksgiving, or eucharistie prayer, then the breaking of
the breed, and finally the distribution oi the breed end
wine to those present. These constitute, strictly speaking,
the principal elements oi the Mass in its entirely Christian
and original aspect.

It is not my aim to adduce here all the texts of the
second or third century in which there is mention made of
the Eucharist end of its essential rites. Ι confine myself
te quoting from the most important of them, namely, the
description ol the Christian meetings for worship on Sunday,
which we find in the first Apoloycy of Justin Martyr.¹
