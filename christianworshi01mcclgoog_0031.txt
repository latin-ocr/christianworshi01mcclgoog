10 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: Its ORIGIN ΛΝΒ avonculus.

ismanifested beyond the limite of Palestine: at Antiooh in
Pisidia there are several “rulers oi the synagoguc;’' at
Corinthu single one.¹ This diversity in Jewish customs
may possibly have contributed to produce that looseness in
the use of terme, or in the actual differences, which meet us
in the earliest Christian documenta when they come to speak
oi the hierarchy ol their newly founded Churches.² The real
differeuces may have been very great3 the primitive Churcbes
were not all influenoed to the same extent by the Christian
social ideal. At Jerusalem they went so far aa to recognise
the community of possessions; but as a general rule they
stopped along way short of this.

The ins itution of the Scaea, iu the same Choreb, served
later on as a support for the tradition that the number of
descons should not exceed that figure. In other Ohurches‚
where the duties to be performed were of a less complex
nature, the number of the officials, as fer as sarving brethreu
were conoemed, was more restricted. There was a similar
cleas cf persone employed in the synagogue; they ere
designated in the Gospel simply as ὑπηρέται (servitore).

In short, whether from imitationes the synagogae, or
simply from the exigencies common to any community, the
first Christiane soon appeared equipped with a hierarchy of
three grades. This hierarchy derived its powers directly or
indireetly from the apostles themselves. As a tole, the
community chose the individual, but the investiture was
made either by the local bishop, or, when this office itself
was in question, by the superior ecclesiastical authority
representing the succession oi the apostles.
