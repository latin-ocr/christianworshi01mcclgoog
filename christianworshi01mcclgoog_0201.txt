admits oi a break where many names and petitione might
have been intercalated. Aa for the prayer beginning with
Oommacc'cactcr, the Sacramentary of Adrian furnishes varia-
tions suited to the solemnity of the day. Later in the same
prayer the list of Popes, now reduced to the first three names,
Linus, Gletes, and Clamant, must have been recited at

Martyrology‚ was extracted from some copy of the Canon.
The names of martyro which follow are also merely a
selection. The Ohurches which adopted the Roman Liturgy
were within their rights in completing that list by adding to
it the names of the saints which they held in special honour.²

admit that the former is not altogether primitive.⁴ Itis
at the same time certain, that from the beginning of the
fifth century the order ol the Roman Canon was already
