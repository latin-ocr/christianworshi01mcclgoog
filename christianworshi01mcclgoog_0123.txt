It was during the episcopata of St. chrodegang (732-
766), and vary probably after his return from Romaiu
754, that the Ohnroh of Metz adopted the Roman Iitmgy.¹
Among all the liturgical innovations, the most obvious
and most striking was the ebant, the Rmtono Cantilewo.
This has left more traces than any other innovation in
the books and eorrsspondence of tha time. Pope Paul
sant from Rome to King Papin, about the year 760, an
Astipbowary and a meamet? In tha same year,
Remadius, son of Charles Martel, and Bishop of Itonen,
having been sent on an embassy to Rome, obtained
permission from the Pope to take baok with him the
sub-director (sewardus) of the Schola Caeterum, in order
to initiate his monks “in the modulatione of psalmody”
aeoording to the Roman method. This teaoher having
been shortly afterwards mealled by tha Pope, the bishop
sent hie Naustrian monks to finish their musical edueation
at Rome itself, where they wara admitted to the Sohool
of Oautors.

These are mara isolated faeta. It was owing to a
general mensurae deame of King Papin, thot¹ the Gallicam
Usa was suppressed. This deeras ie not forthcoming, but
mention of it is found in the admonitio gemmulis put

“clerum abundanter lage divina Romanaque imbutum cantilena
morem atquo ordinum Romanae Eoeltaim aurroro praecepit, quod usque
ad id tompus in Mettensi Ecolesia iactum minima tuit ” (Paulus Diaoonus,
Gesta Epp. Mea: Migne, Pet. Lot, rol. xow. p. 709).
