THE TWO clausmors Usus OF Tiili narlrt WEST. 95

However this may be, the important political position of
the city of Milan was not maintained beyond the early years

of the fifth century. The glory of its episcopal see was
dimmed at the same time, and Rome found herself thus
relieved from a competition which might heve ended in the
establisbment of a rival. It was scarcely possible, indeed,
to undo an accomplished fact. The Popes considered,
apparently, that no inconvenieuce would an'se if liturgieal
usages somewhat different from their own were allowed to
continue; in any case, there were more urgent questions
secking solution. They confined their efforts to defending
their metropolitan diocese from the invasion of the Gallicas
ritual, and left the Churches of other provinces to make their
arrangements on this point as they felt inclined. Circum·
stanoes, moreover, were not favourable to the development of
ecclesiastica] centralisetion. National barriers soon rose up
between Rome end the Cburohes of the barbaric kingdoms
founded in Gaul and Spain.l

¹ The view tbst 1 have just put forward bas, from the first edition of
this book, been contested by divers persons. These among thom whose
opinion is of weigbt, put forward another explanation. The Galliaco
ritual, according to them, is nono other tiron the ancient Roman ritual‚
which, reformed at Rome in tho fourth century, maintained its position
in the provinces. They give even the name of the reformet-Pope
Damasus Unfortnnetely‚ however, thoy aro not able to adduce testimony,
citheron bis behalf. or that oi any other. This new hypothesis is not
more fully supported by documentary evidence than mine. Moroover, how
could we explain, on this assumption, the ieet that Pope innocentior
from recognising the ancient use of his own Churcli in the Gallicas ritual‚
treats it as oi foreign importation (olirmde adeptum exemplam? How,
also, can we explain why Africa, so joeleus of its own peculiaritics, wass
keen to accept the Roman reform, while St. Ambrose‚ Bonism by birth and
disposition, refused to introduce it into bis Cburch? Compering hypothesis
with hypothesis, 1 continue to believe that minc is moro in conformity with
facts and situations than the other. Norertheless, it is te be well under·
stood that I do not put it forth as a definitive solution. 1 am ready te
abendon it if any one can put forth a better. Cf. my article entitled, ‘⁵ Sur
l’Origine de la Liturgie Gallicane‚” in the Becare d’Hs‘st. de nist. set, lbilb,
