were introduced into it, and then, in their turn, the
assembly of the faithful. The latter portion corresponde
with the Roman ceremony of the depositio, bnt it contains
certain details which resemble those in the consecretion
of the altar by water and anointing. The Frankieh
liturgiolcgists oi the eighth and ninth centurias, who

took to meddling with the two rituale by combining
them, were not always elever enough to avoid confusions
and repetitione. More complicatione were the result in
this case than in that of the ordination rituel The seme
procedure was not everywhere adopted, and the Ordines
which I publish exhibit different modes of combination.
As for the existing Pontifical, it is the result of a still
more complex operation. Taken as a whole, however, we
recognise in it clearly the coexistence of the two rituale
which I have described seriatim.

The former of the two, a ritual of a funerery type,ie
purely and decidedly Reman, as we readily gether both
from the documenta themselves and by its agreement with
what we know of ancient Roman practice in such mettere.
But the other ritual-a ritnal of abaptiemal character-can
we say with certainty that it is purely oi a Gallicae type?

We must make here, I think, some distinctions. Ae
the beginning end in the middle of this ceremcny we
meet with prayers which are more Romen then Gellicen
in type and style. I refer to the prayer Mcgaifieere,
the consecrating prayers recited by the biehop in the
middle of the basilice, the prayer Dece qui lece, end the
eucharistie formnlery Deus sanctificationum. It is pos·
sible that these were borrowed from the Roman Iitnrgy.¹
I would remark here, in the first place, that the prayer
Mcyec'fiecrc is unknown tc the Gelasian Sacramentery
