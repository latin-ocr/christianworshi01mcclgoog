Thera was thus e metropolis without as yet a metro-
politan. Such was the case, for example, in the Church
at Antioch.

When such inter-relations were represented by the
episcopete with its hierarchieal staff, these are found to
correspond with· tolerable eractness 10 certain inst'tutiona
of the Empire. We may compare the Bishops of Carthege
Alexandria, and Antioch to the Proconaul of Africa, to the
Profectus Egypt, and to the Legata of Syria respectivcly‚
but it is certain that there was no imitation intended.
The forms of civil government in question arose out of
geographioal exigencies and from certain historicel relations
reaulting from these erigenoies. It was the same with 1110
Christian primacies. The Bishop of Carthago became the
chief of 1110 African bishops, because it was from the Church
of Carthage that the founders of the Ohurches ol Africa had
gone forth, and their starting out from that city was oon·
ditioned hythe geographical disposition of the country which

had made Carthage a natural centre. The same may be
said of other 110111ναί metropolitan sees, which are the most

ancient of all.

Beyond this, however, there is no further resemblance,
during the period anterior to the end of the third century,
between the areas of the metropolitan sees of the Church
aud the provincial divisione of the Empire. What
little we know of the councils held in those carly times
is sufficient to prove thet there was no attempt 10
gnoup the Churches according to 1110 divisione of the civil
provinces.

These councils, 1110 earliest of which date back 10 the
later years of the second century, constitute every re·
. markable revelation of ecclesiastical inter-diocesan relations.
At the time that Tertullian wrote his De chuoa'is (cir. 220)
they were unknown in Africe3 in the Greek-speaking coun-
tries, on the contrary, they were already an established
