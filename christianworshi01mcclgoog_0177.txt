The ancient liturgical manuscripts found in the British
Isles ere 111, with 0111 01 two exceptione, books 01 1 mixed
character-in the main Romen, but with certain Gullican
details The most importent is the Stewe Missel‚¹ which
contains, at the 111101 St. John’s Gospel,en01dinary[and

The Letin texts ere partly 01 the eighth and partly 01 the
tenth century. Nearly all the rubries are in 1111111111111,
iu which also are many additions in the blank opacae 1111

final 01111011 costros, 111, in the Hanc ipitur. There are,
however, interpolatione in various places, sometimes in
the earlier, sometimes in the later hand. Among these
interpolations, one ol the most euricus is that 01 the
