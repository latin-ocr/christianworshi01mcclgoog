we bave no document relating to its protanam or use
earlier than the beginning of the sixth century. At the
time when it first comes before us, thetis, under Pope
Symmachus, the Roman Church was separated horn Con·

the latter date Rome bad ceased to owe allegiance to the
emperors, aud bad passed under the rule cf barbarian

century to find a favourable time for its institution On
the other hand, the Bishops of Gaul and Spain¹ had,
apart from the Roman palliam, which had been granted te
some of them from the sixth century onward, apulliam
which they used as a sign of office, and which appears
to have had the same shape as that wem by the Pope.
This would lead us tc believe that the Imperial grant
of this ornament went back to a time when the whole
of Gaul was still Roman, that is to say, to the first half of
the fifth century, The African bishops also wore the pal-
lium as a sign of their cilice.l If they held it from the
emperor, they must have received it before the invasion
of the Vandals. Itis to the same period that we must
refer the most ancient mention of the palliaco found in
