CHAPTER V.

BOOKS OF THE LATIN lll'l'E.

Auernur books of the Latin rite are much rerer than
we might be led to expect. It is useless to look for
anything ol the kind in the Danuhian provinces or in Latin
illyricum, where the Churches of Dorostorum Serdica,
Salona, Sirmium, Siscia, and Savaria once llourished. A
wholesale destruction was affected in these ceuntries by
the Germanic, Slav, and Finnish barbaricus, and though,

no doubt, these countries bave their liturgieal history, it
begins very late, thet is, in the ninth century, et the time
when the missioneries from Rome ried with those from
Constantinople in cvangelising the conquering tribes which
thenceforward took up their abode in those regions. Africa,
also, has nothing tc offer us, unless it be the mention of a
tataros sacramentam compiled in Mauritania, but now
hopelessly laetanda few decisione, scattered among the
decrees ol the couneils. Ancient manuscripts of the Spanish
Liturgy are said still to exist, but up te the present time
nothing is forthcoming except the Mozarabic Missel, which
was recovered by the efforts ef Oardinal Ximenes. Witha
