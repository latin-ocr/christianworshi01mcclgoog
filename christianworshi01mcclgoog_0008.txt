AUTHOR'S PREFAOE.

Tms volume contains the description and explanation
of the chief eeremonies of Catholie worship ae they
were performed in the Latin Churehee of the West
from the fourth to the ninth century. The title is
somewhat ambitione, and is not exaetly that which
Iwould have ehosen. But Ι did not feel justified
in disregarding the suggestions of my publieher, and
have had to relegate to the sub-title the description
which Ι had in view.

The eontants represent, in the main, merely notes
of my lecturas. Ι have dealt with this subject on
two or three oeeaeione in my teaehing at the Ι restitut
carolique at Paris. My pupils and other persons
having expressed a wish to have the lectures
printed, I am now able to eotisly their desire.

It ie, indeed, but a modest contribution to the
subject, and I make no pretension to eompare this
little book with the great works of the Freneh and
foreign liturgiologists, who, from the serenteenth
eentnry onvards, have explored every department of
this vast domain. Small books, however, have their
use, and mine, perhaps, may be weleomed by beginnere
who want a general view ol the subject, or by busy

persple who are engaged iu kindred studies abad desire
