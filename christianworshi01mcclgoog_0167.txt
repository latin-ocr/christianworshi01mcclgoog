In the second volume of his Musaeum Italicam,¹ Mabillon
published some of the Ordines Βοιιιαιιι, οι ritual directions for
different ceremonies. All these documenta are not of the
same date, and it is possible to trece in them modificatione
which were made in the Pontifioal Liturgy from the ninth
to the fifteenth centuries. It is only with the most ancient
that we have to deal here, and we must cf course put
aside those which correspond to the Roman Liturgy as it
has been modified owing to various influences, whether in
Franco or at Rome, subsequent to the ninth century. I
shall therefore select only N os. I., VH, VIH, end IX.
out of the whole series of the Ordines. The first of these
relatas to the liturgy οι the Mass, the second to baptism,
und the two others to the ceremonias et ordination.

We must, moreover, distinguieh between the different
parts of the Ordo Romanas I. as it is published by
Mabillon. Τιιο whole of it, indeed, is taken from manu-
scripte of the ninth century, and it may be taken for
granted thet all of it existed in the early years os that
century. But all the parts do not exhibit to the same
extent a Roman impress.

Alter an introduction relating to the apportioning oi
the liturgical service among the clerice oi the seven
regions of Rome, the Ordo gives us a description οι the
stational Mass, presided over by the Pope. This first
part comprises Chapters 1-21 of Mabillon.

It is found, with an abrupt break at this point, in
several manuscripts cited by Mabillon and others, and
especially in that of Verona, published by Fr. Bianohini.a
