at the beginning of the maeting, aa coming forward at
the summoue of the daacon, and as leaving the sacred

building astera special prayer, followed by the bishop's
blessing. This custom was still observed at Reum in the
middle of the fifth century, as we have Sozomen’s¹ express
authority for this.

The final ceremony-that of moonciliation-is found in
the Gelasian Sacramentary,² with very copious formularies.

By the help of this text wa can imagine curselves
at Rome on Maundy l'hursday, the day specially eet
spart in that city for the reconciliation of penitents.⁸
Mass begins without any singing-that is to say, with·
out the chanting of the Introit ⁴-and without the Pope’s
salutation of the congregation by the Dominus somam.
He recites an introductory prayer,⁶ after which a dercon

brings before him the penitents,⁰ who prostrate themselves
full length in the centra of the churoh The deacon than

addresses the Pope as follows :-

Adest, ο venerabilis pontifex, tempus acceptum, dies propitiationis
divinae et salutis humanae, qua mors interitum et vita accepit aeterna
principium, quando in vinea DomIni Sabaoth sic novorum plantatio

¹ noo. aas. (tf. supra, p. 171.

² 1. 88: ‘¹ Orat. s'a palata jeria. Pedem die non psallitur, nec salutat,
idest non dicit Dosas'aas vobiscum et reconciliatio paenitentis.” 'lbree
prayers follow, then: “Ordo ommibus publicam preamium. Egreditur
paenitens de loeo ubi paenitentiam gessit et in memte praesentatur ecclesie,
prostrato omni corpore in terra, et postulat in his verbis diaconus.”

³ Latter of Innoccnt to Decentiua, c. 7: cf. lah. Poat, vol i. p. cxi.

⁴ 'Pha Kyris Mon is no doubt anppressed beccum it comes so shortly
after: the same applies to the Gloria ἑο mbo. all these details, mors
or less definitely given, are contradicted by the Ordines of the ninth century,
which imply that the Mass began in tha usual way. 'l'he latter oentain,
moreover, no vestiga oi the reconciliation of penitenfs on Maundy Thumday.
Itis possible that this ceremony may have been abandoned in the course
of tho eighth century.

⁶ 'l'he Gelasian Sacramentary gives three different forma of it, which

are evidently alternatim
⁸ ‘l‘he rubric and the formularies are always in the singular.
