2. lte Dalmatio.

Besidcs these two essentffl vestments, common ιο all

the clergy, the Pope and hia deacons wore, on festivals,
between the ordinary tunic (liceo) and the planeta, a second
tunic with large sleeves, called a dalmatio. This combi-
nation of the three garments was used considerably anterior
ιο the time when the ecclesiastical costuma became sterec
typed. On the day of his martyrdom (258) St Cypriam
wore a linen tunic, a dalmatic, and an over-garment,
enswering ιο the paracta, or planeta.¹ As early as the
end oi the fifth century the dalmatio, which had passed out
of fashion as an ordinary article oi clothing, had become
the diednguiahing badge cf the Pope and his clergy? The
Pope sometimes granted it ae an honorary decoration ιο
biehops and dcaoons os other (lhurches. Pope Symmachus
(circ. 513) confened this privilege on the deacons oi Arles;

St. Gregory made a similar giit (599) to the Bishop oi Gap
and his archdeacon.³ The bishops and deaccns ci Muenna,

¹Arlc proceres, 5: “Se lacerna byrro exspoliarit et genu in terre
flexit et in orationem se Domino prostravit Et cum se dalmatia
exspoliasset et diaconibus tradidisset, in linea stetit et coepit speculatum
sustinere.”

² 'l'he Lab. Pontis. (rol. i. p. 171, cf my edition) attributes the inho·
ductiou ci it to Pope Silvester. The legendary liic oi St. Silvester,
written at the end of the flith century, dces aot make it go back sc iar,
but implies that it had been in use for aborta century. It should hc
noted that, according to the author oi this document, the Roman disocnal
tuuicle was at the outset the same as the colchus, which the emperor
Honorius commanded his senators tc wear as their outdcor tunio(see αμα,

379).

country. We oitcn seo quoted a similar conoessicn by Pope Zacharias ιο

apocryphal letter (J affe, sats).
