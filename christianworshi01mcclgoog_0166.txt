metropolitan archivas of Ravenna. The liturgica] Roll, on
the back of which it was transcribod, must therefore have
the same prooeoancc. We have hera, then, a collection of
praycrs which had been in use in tha (lhurch of Ravenna.

One of them only, the twenty-sevanth is found in any
known document of the Roman liturgy. It figures in one
of the Messes for Ohn’stmas Day² in the Leonian Sacra·
mantnry, and among a group of prayars for the same festival
in tha Gregorian Sacramentary? The Ravenna praycrs are
not arranged in tha order observad in the Mass. There
is no attempt at any distribution of this kind, for they
are simply placed one after the other. They could hova
served as wall for the Office aa for the Mass, and this
circumstance detracta considerably from tho valna of the
Ravenna Roll.

It is, moreover‚ difficnlt to assign e date to it. The
uncials are rather coarsely formed, and it may be attributed
with equal probability tc the eighth or ninth as wall as
tc the aixth centurias.

Mons. Chatelain has published8 e series of praycrs,

which are in the scriptos the aeventh or eighth century,
eud accompanied by a certain number of Tironian notas*
from a manuscript which came from ΒοΙὼίο.4 They number
serenteen in all, and comprise the post commocio prayer
and the Sacram they ara Roman in type, and are found in
the sacramentarios cf that uso, especially in the Leonian
Sacramentary.⁵
