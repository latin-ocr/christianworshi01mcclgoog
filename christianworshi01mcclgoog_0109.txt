tho uae whichis conventionally called the Gallican. The
latter was, therefore, already in existence at the beginning
of the fifth century; it had even sufficient vigour to enter
into competition with tha Roman Iiturgy, and that, too,
up to the surburbicarian diocese itself. This use, as is
evident from very numerous documents, was followed by the
Churches of N orthem Italy (metropolitan diocese of Milan)²
and by those in Gaul, Spain, Britain, and Ireland. From
what we can learn, however, from allusione by the Christian
oratore and synodioal decrees of Africa, the use there seems
to have been inabsoluta conformity with the use of Romo
and of Southern Italy. We thus find Rome and Carthago
on one side, and on the other Milan and the countn'es
beyond the Alps.

In grouping the transalpina countries with Milan, Ι
imply that the Ambrosian Iiturgyis identical with the
Gallican. This is a view which is not generally accepted.
There is no difficulty, on the other hand, in the identification
of tha liturgy of the Churches of Spain, or Mozarabio
Iiturgy, up to the eleventh century, with that which was
followed hythe Ohurches of Gaul before Charlemagne, and
with that which obtained in the British Isles before tho
Roman missione of the seventh century. With regard to
the Ambrosian Liturgy it is, in its present etate, very
different from other types of the Gallican Liturgy, but we

¹ We haro no document-ary evidence for the usos followed in Aquileia,
in tho Danubian provinces, and in Dahnatia. Itis probable that the use
obscrved in Aquileia and tho Danuffian provinces resembled rather tho
Milan than the Roman Liturgy. Dum. G. Morin has publishod lately
(lietera Boset, 1902, p. 1) a Lectionary of tho coepes, which probably
belonged to Aquileia, and it contains nothing oppsed to this view. Thc
Latin liturgicol fragments which are included in tho Arion texts pub·
lished by Mai (Sartpt. va, vol. iii. p. 201111 ιαμ cf. P. L, vol. xiii.
p. 611) are, in my opinion, assignable to thc Danubian region. Sig. Mercati
aa throvn fresh light upon them in a noto to llis Stude· e Teati of the
vatican, fasc. 7, p. 47.
