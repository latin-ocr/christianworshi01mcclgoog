Τ111 Gregorian Sacramentary comprisedr-lst, the Ordi-
nary of the Mass; 2nd‚ the Prayers‚ Profaees, and other
variable parts of the Mass, reoited or ohanted by the bishop
or offieiating priest, on festival and stationed days. This
series embraoes the entire course of the ecclesiastice] year,
beginning with Christmas Eva. 3rd‚ Prayers at the ordination
of daurons, priests, and bishops.

The second pert, by iar the most importantia the main
part of the Sacramentary. As I have said, it oontains only
the Messes for great festivals and solemn statione. There
are none for the ordinary Sandays between the Epiphany
and Lent and from the oetam oi Easter to Advent. Advent
with Christmastida, Lent with Bastar Week, Asoeneion Day,
Whitsunday, and Ember days are all that is represented by
the propriam de tempore ol later Missals. The festivals of
saints whioh are on fixed days are distributed more or less

systematioally among the movable fausta, but in such away

that Lent and Easter Week form an uninterrupted series.
The pleae of the station is always expressly indicated,

unless the name of the saint alone is sufficient to designate

¹ For the Gregorisn Sacramentary I melre use of Muratori's edition,
praepa 11111111 aaa, vol. ii. In his notas on tireBoolc os Gerrre (tho Prayer
Book ol Aedelwald tho Bisbop, eommonly ealled “ The Book ol Ceme,’' ed.
by Dom A. B. Kuypers, Cambridge, 1901), p. 511 tho separate part, Mr.
Edmund Bishop oonsidors it arrident that in my opinion the Sacramentary
ol Adrion is exclusivoly represented by pp. 1-138 ol Muratori’a edition,
while, in lris opinion, pp. asi-272 and att-361 should also be inoludad.
Pagae 357-86100nrainthe lorms of ordination lor bishops, priests, and
deaoona, and it will be seon above, as also in preooding editions of the present
work, tlsatI have mentioned these formularies as eonstituting part ol tbe
Sacramentary in question. As lar as this point, therefore, is ‹mnoernsd hir.
Bishop's eritieism is without foundation. As to pp. all-272, I willingly
admit with him that they should be added to pp. 1-138, and that they were
only separated lrom them bya mistalso in the arrangement oi the pages.
Euan thou, with this addition, the Saommentaryis still a very inoompleta
111111 1sdhero to my belief that, talreu by 111111 does not represent
the entire collection ol liturgieal formularies in use at Rome during the
eighth oentury.
