et least not in this place. It is evidently en Eastern im-
portation, or iether Byzantine. At the time of the second
Council of Veison (529), it was used only et “ publio Messes.”
This counoil decreed (o. 3) thet it wes to be sung et all
Messes without distinction.

In pleoc of the Trieegion we find in the Mozerebic end
Ambrosien Missals the Gloria io excoles, which is here¹ a
Romen importetion.

The second chent, that of the Kyoio, is preserved in the
Ambrosien Liturgy, but hee disappeered from the Mozerebic.
It was customary at Milen, es in Geul, to restrict the
number of Kyros sung to three. The Kyro'e was introduced
in imitation of Eestern usage, but in the Oriental liturgico
it is only employed es the responso of the peoplo to the
petitions oi the Dieconel In'teny, end even at Rome it had at
first e strict connection with that liteny. In the Gallicen
use it was e speeies oi chent absolutely unconnected with

the Litany.

In the time oi the Oouncil of Veison² the Kyra'e was

¹ Iray here, for it is certain that the Gloria ia arechis, aa e chaut in
the ΟΜ, wea known in Spain und Northern Italy from tho aeventh
century at latest (cone. Tol, iv. 12: Sacrament. Gall, eradicaretur).
'Phe Trisegion is mentioned in the liic of tlt. Gery, Biehop of (umbrat
in the aeventh century: “Ajae ajon, ojus, per trinum numerum imposuit
in nomine Trinitatis '’ (Aeol. Bell, vol. vii. p. 393).

’comit Veronae, o. 3: “m quia tam 'nn aede Apostolioa quam etiam
per totas Orientales etque Italiae provincias duloia et nimium salutaria
consuetudo eet intromissa ut Kyrie eleison frequentius eum grandi affeetu
et compunctione dioatnrr placuit etiam nobis ut in omnibus ecclesiis
nostris ieta tam saneta oonsuetudo etad matutinum et ad missas et ad
vesperam, Deo propitio intromittatur. Et in omnibus missis, seu in matu-
tinia, seu in quadragesimalibus, eeu in illis queo pro defunctorum oom-
memoratione flunt, sempor Sanctae Sumtus, Sanctae, eo ordino quo modo
ad miraeo publioos dicitur, dici debeat; quia tam aanota et tam dulcia
et desiderabilis vox, etiamsi dic noctuque possit dici, festidium non possit
generare.” The &adar here referred to ia evidently the Triragion, and
not the &aaut aster the Profaoe. Ohaerre that the connoil does not
name Spain among the oountrice where it was customary to nae the

Kyric.
