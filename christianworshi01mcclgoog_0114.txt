Gallican Liturgy had reached that stage of development
which it possessed when it spread throughout the west,
and at the very moment when the West experienced the
need of a definitely fixed liturgy.

This is not all Itis well known by every one that the
Gallican Litargy, in the features which distinguish it from
the Roman use, betrays all the characteristios of the Eestern
liturgias. We shall see, further on, that some of its formu-
laries are to be found word for word in the Greek texts which
were in use in the Churohes of the Syro-Byzantina rite either

in the fourth century or somewhat later. This close resem- .

blance, this essential identity, implies an importation. The

West towards the middle of the fourth century. Now,
putting aside the presence of the Court at Milan, and the
numerous assemblies of Oriental bishops which were held
there, we have to take into account a further feet of grave

of this eouncil, Auxentius maintained his position, and
remained fifteen years in his see, notwithstanding the efforts
made to dislodge him. This would seem to indicate that he
had a strength of mind beyond the common. We can readily
believe, therefore, that during his long episcopate he made
some impression upon his clergy and upon the internal
organisation of his Charch. St. Ambrose, his successor, found
