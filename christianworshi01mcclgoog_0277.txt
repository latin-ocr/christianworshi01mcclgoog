These formularies were said, in Italy at least, from
separate rolla, which ,it was customary to decorate as
sumptuously as possible. The text was ornamented here
and there with miniatures illustrative of various passages,
such as the angelis choir, the earth illuminated with
celestial light, the church, the officiating deaoon, bees,
eto. Tha name ol the sovereign at the end was sometimes
accompanied by his portrait.² In the ornamentation of
these rolls the figures were placed upside down, so that
the reader observed them turned in the opposite direction
from the text. This custom finds its explanation in the
fact thet each roll, as it was read, was allowed to lall over
the side oi the ambo, so that its end could ba seizad by
members of the congregation, and the miniatures contem·
plated while the deacon continued his chanting of the
remainder.

The Mozarabic liturgy contains here, besides the
blessing oi the new tire, which is not, perhaps, primitive
in this place, a twofold benediction, namely, that of the
lamp and that of the candles. There were two officiating
ministers-deaccns—who must either have composed the

necessary formularies themselves, or have known them by
heart.
