arrunerean narrares. 381

when the saint disembarked on the coast of Africa, alter
his retum from exile, the nobles spread cut their planetas
over his head ιο shelter him from the rain which was
falling at the time. John, the deaoon, in his Life of st.
Gregory, describes the costume of that Pope and his father
Gordianus from contemporary pictures;' both are dressed
alike, and each wears over the dalmatie a chestnut-coloured
planeta ,

The under-tunic hae become the albe, hom which have
been derived, through various modificatione, the canon’s
rochet and the surplice3 both of these garmcnts may be
worn by clerks of different orders. The planeta has
become the chasuble, now scarcely ever worn¹ except by
priests and bishops. It was a costly germont, and the
inferior clergy gave up its use at an early date.

Beyond the limite of Rome, the liturgieal dress com·
prised much the same garments, namely, the albe (reciae
lime, albe, στιχάριον) and the planeta, called also maele
(chasuble) or amphibolam? and in Greek phdoaiea (φελόνιον).
The albe of the deacon, although not of the shape of the
dalmatic, which was peorihar ιο the Roman use, was,
however, ofa more costly material than that worn by the
ordinary olerk. It was not confined ιο the waist bya
girdle, but fell straight from the shoulders.⁰

¹ In Lcnt and other penitential seaeons, it is still worn by the deaceae
and subdeaoons.

² These two terma are mot with for the first time to denote a liturgieal
vestment in the troatiae of St. Germain ol Paris At Rome, the word
planete was need, hut its origin is unknown. The term moola, or rather
mdis, appears thero sor the first time in the Life oi Stephon 11.
(In'b. Pera, vol. i. p. 443, 1. 18), aad again endor a very corrept form
(caedualla).

³ It is thus described by St. Germain of Paria; the Greek desecas have
always worn it in this manner.
