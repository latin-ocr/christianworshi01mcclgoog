The only angel of whom we find a commemoration
before the ninth century is St. Michael Festivels of
this kind can be attributed only to the dedicatione ol
churches. This was the case, in fact, with the Byzantina
festival oi the 8th of November, relative to the Church oi
St Michael in the bathe of Arcadius ;² also with the festival
of the 8th of May, relative to the celebrated sanctuary
of Monte Gargano, and vvith that of the 29th of September,
relative to a church (destroyed long ago) in the suburbe of
Rome at the sixth milestone on the Via Solaria. This
festival of St. Michaelis the only one of the kind which
appears in the early Roman liturgiccl books. It is found
in an authority as early as the Lconian Sacramentary, that
is, of the sixth century. The Gallican books and colendam
make no mention of a day especially assigned to the
commemoration of St. Michael the archangel.

The festival of the Meccebees (August 1) seems to have
been universally observcd in the Ohurch about the fifth
century. Itis mentioned in all the calendas, beginning
with the most ancient form of the Hieronymian Martymlogy.⁸
It does not occur, however, in any of the Gallican or Roman
liturgical books, except the Gelasian Sacramentery. The
commemoration of the Maccabeos, occurring‚ as it does, in
the kalende of August, must have been eclipsed by the
festival oi St. Petere vinculis.
