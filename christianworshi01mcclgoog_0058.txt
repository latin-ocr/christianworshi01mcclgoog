they appealed to Reme, or even in preference to Rome, had
certainly no intentiones ereeting an opposition between
these two great authorities, or even of placing the Imperial
Ohurch on a level with the apostolic see. This appeal to
them was mede simultaneously on the supposition thet they

could not act otherwise than in concert, and the issue
invariably justified this assumption. When the eppeal ivae
mede ιο Milan alone, es the Gallicae Biehope ere known
tc heve done on several occasione, it was only because Milan
was nearer to them arrd for this reason had a better
opportunity of obtaining information. Queetions continued
to be submittcd ιο Rome all the same. We may point out
ae instancee of such appeals‚ those ol Himerius, Bishop
of Tarragona, in 384, of Victricine, Bishop of Rouen, in 403,
and of Exuperius, Bishop of Toulouee, in 404. We still
possess the decretale ol Siricius and Innocent,¹ in which
they replied to the questions submitted by these bishops
of Spain and Gaul.

The proeminent position, however, ef the see of Milan
could not have been fmther accentueted without in the end
eetablishing a precedent which might be cited against tho
pre-eminence of Rome. The Popes soon realised this, and
neglected no opportunity of defending themselves against
this incipient rivalry. It is not known what pert they took
in the foundation of the metropolitan see of Aquileia, but it
ie certain thet they helped ιο create the metropolitan discsse
of Raram, formed et the expense of that of Milan.² Ina
