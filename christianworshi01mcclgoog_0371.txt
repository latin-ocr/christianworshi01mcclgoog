Tm authorities which have come down to us on the
ritas of ordination in the Latin Ohuroh are as follows :-

1. The Stctctc Ecclesiae Antiqua, a collection of dis·
ciplinary and liturgieal canons drawn up in Gaul, in the
province of Arlea, about the beginning of the sixth century.¹
We find in them the principel ceremonias of ordination
ior all the orders. Itia evident from these ceremonias
that the uae was Gallican. Itis probably the only text
in which that neeis preserved free from any admixtum,
ior the Gallicam liturgical books do not contain the cera·
monica of ordination.

2. The Romae Sacramentum-We must confine our

it was a mouth. 'l'ho second pseudoSilrostrian Oouncss requires for it ten
years. Aa te tho actual discipline,seo the decretale cited above, p. ete.
note 3. Tha waramum, which mentions eighty lectore and sorry-ove
acolytos, enumeratos only twenty-two exercista at Rome.

¹ The inscriptions, moreover, mention an exoroiat, who died in 511, at
Rolnam and another at Corne, in 526 (Ocrp.1aecr.laat.,vol. ix„ No. 1381:
voh a, No. 6428).

'Murem Qatallen, vol. i. p. 382: hialnory, 8. cocere p. 50. This
collection waa inserted, under the title Gorrcils'cm contagium mrim
in the Spanish body oi canem (Hispano), from whence it paned into that oi
the pseudo-Isidore. It is still quoted by many under the latter title, and,
what is more serious, prononneed as an authority ior African acclamastical
unges iu the ioumh century.
