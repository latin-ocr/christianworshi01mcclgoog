orders being found in another place, but, by an oversight‚
at the end of the formulariee relating to the subdeaoons,
the compiler has left a fragment of the rite {for the ordi·
nation 01 priests.

These interpolatione are not isolated instanoes, as I shall
soon have occasion to point out.

In the arrangement 01 111 various festivals, there are often
discrepanoies between the Gelasian and Gregorian Sacra·
mentaries. The former inserts certain festivals which the
latter omits, and m'ce 11111. Now, it must be remarked 1111
in these divergencies the Gregorian has the support of the
Leonian Sacramentery, of which Ι shall speak later on;
that 11 10 say, it has onita side a purely Roman com·
pilation, free from any Frankish or Gallioan influenoe. The
Iconian never mentions any festival characteristic of the
Gelasian Sacramentary. On the contrary, it contains several
festivals peculiar to the Gregorian, namely, those 01 111
Seven Brothers (J uly 10), St Stephen, the Pope (August 2),
SS. Felicissimae and Agapitus (August 6), SS. Felix and
Adauetus (August 30), and S. Chrysogonus (November 24).
It inserts, moreover, although out of its proper place, the
anniversery of St. Silvester, a festival unknown 10 the
Gelasian Calendar, and finally, aa in the Gregorien Sacra·
mentary‚ it places the Feast of St. Euphemia on September
16, whereas the Gelasian assigns it to April 13.ι This last
divergenoe‚ which is also met with in the Hieronymien
Martyrology and in the Mozarabio Missal, may well have
been suggested by the Gallican use. The same may be said
01 the festivals 01 111 Invention of tho True Crosa and the
Martyrdom 01 St. John Baptist, which ara inserted in the
Gallioan liturgioal books, but for which no Roman docu-
ment can be cited as an authority. Iwould also point out

¹ This ie also tha day on which thie festival is marked in the Celendur
of Oanbege and in all the Greek oslendars.
