ierth by Charlemcgne in 789.ι The passage (cap. 80) reads
as follows :-

Ornat clara—Ut aarum Romanm pleniter discant et ordinabiliter
per nocturnale wel gradale officium peragatur, secundnm quod beatae
memoriae genitor noster Pippinus rex decorarit ut fieret, quando
Gallicanum tulit, ob unanimitatem apostelicae aedis et sanctae Dei
Ecclesiae pacificam concordiam.²

It was net, therefore, charlemagne, aa has often been
stated, but Pcpin the Short, who abolished the Gallicae
Iitnrgy. This reform had become necessary. The Frenkish
Ohurch, during the reigns of the latest Merovingians, hed

fallen into a sed state of corruption, disorganisation, and
ignorance. There was no religione centra anywhere, no
metropolis whose customs being better regulated and better
preserved might serve as a model and become the point of
departure lor a reformation. The Vieigothie Ohurch hed
a centre at Teleda, a recognised head in the metropolitan
ei this town, and an unique disciplinary cede-the Hispane
collection. The Liturgy oi Toledo was then the liturgy
of the whole of Spain. The Frankish Ohurch possessed
frontiers only, and lacked a capital. ine Frankieh Epis·
copate, except when the king er the Pope took the direc-
tion ef it, was an acephalous episcopate.⁸ Each Choreh
possessed its hook of canons end its liturgical use.

² Pago 61 oi the edition ol Boratius (Μ. Germ. Lepet, Sect. 11.‚v01.i.,
Part I.). (ll. the Epistola Gerwratis put forth between 786 and 800 (ibid,
p. 80): “Acccnei praeterea venerandae memoriae Pippini genitoris nostri
exemplis, qui totas Galliarum eeclesias Murenae traditionis auo studio
cantibus decoravit.”

⁸Thia position never varied. It was the cese heloro the merovingicae,
aad continued so afterwards. Evcry eli'ort to establish in Franco an
eeclesiastical power superior to the blahops—apart irem the Pope or
Govemment-haa invariably resultedin lailure. The metropolitan authority
itseli never cnjeyed a strong position. The archbiahopa are no longer
more than dignitarics, and it would be easy te prove that, with a few
iselsted exceptione, they have never been mything more.
