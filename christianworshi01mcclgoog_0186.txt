subject to considerable development, especially in the first
part of it, which contains the invocation of Saints. But
the conclusion, in which the response occurs, Tc rogamus,
cccli oce, has quite an ancient ring about it, and possessos
a great resemblance to the petitione in the litanias used
in the Greek Ohurch. Althougb the earliest text in
which it occurs goes back only to the eighth century,
it is probable that it is much more ancient.

It is evident, moreover, that the place assigned to the
Kyric elciaco in the Roman litany is not that given to it
in the Eastcrn Churcbes. In the Roman Litany it occurs
at the beginning and the end, and is said alternately by
the precentor and the congregation. In the East it
formed the people’s response to the petitione in the
Diaconal Litany. St. Gregory was already aware of this
difference.¹ It arose from the fact that the Kyric was
adventitious in the Roman Ohurch, aa it was throughout the
antire West.² The formulary Tc rogamus, aedi vaca, however,

could not be omitted, since it occupies in the Roman
Litany the same place as the Kyric cleison in the Greek.
Another place had to be found for the latter. It is a
somewhat singular thing that the Kycic, which is ol later
date at Roma than the Litany, should now be preserved in

¹ Ep. ix. 12: “Kyra'e eleison autem nos neque diximus neque dicimus
sieut a Graecis dicitur, qnia in Graeciis simul omncs dieunt, apud nos
autem a clericis dicitur et apopulo respondetur: et totidem vicibus etiam
Christe cleison dicitur. quod apud Graecos nullo modo dicitnr.”

² Council of l'aiaon (529), c. 3: “Et qnia tam in aede apostolica quum
etiam per totas orientales atque Italiae provincias dulcis et nimium
salutariseonsuctudo est intromissa ut Kyrie cleison frequentius cum grandi
affectu et compunctione dicatur,” otc. The Conneil agreed to the intro-
duction of this cusbrm into the (lhurehes of the province of Arles. in
which it was still unknown. 'l'lre word {streniam cannot have any
reference lo the Baetem Cburclres, which, us wc know. used tho Kyric
from tha remotest times. 'l'he drawing up es tbc t‘anon is somewhat
defective on this point. but it is clear thot the Oouncil of Vaison
regarded the Kysis then in use at Rome and in Itnly (llilan) as au
impetrationes somewhat recent date.
