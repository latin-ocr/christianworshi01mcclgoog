AssumingthatthedomainoftheGallicanIiturgyextonded
up to the metropolitan diocese of the Pope, embracing North
Italy, or, at the least, the metropolitan diocese of Milan, the
way becomes open for the solution of an obscure and conten·
tious question: that of the origin of the Gallican Liturgy.

The English liturgiologists, who have been much oceu-

it implies numerous and varied ritas arranged in a certain

those simple and still unfixed forms which can be definitely
assigned to, or may be assumed to have existed in, the
liturgy of the second century. Its development corresponds
at tlre earliest with the conditiones things iu the fourth
century. It shows an advenae upon that of the Apostolic

Now, in the fourth century, the ecclesiastical influenoe of
Lyons was almost nonexistent. This city, after the new
provincial organisation under Diocletian‚ had lost its position
as metropolis of the three Gauls. The glory and influence os
