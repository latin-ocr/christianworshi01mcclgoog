which follows (27), entitled, “For the People,’' deals in
detail with all the objecto and classes 61 persons prayed
for by the Church in her solemn supplicatione-the well·

of the Church, for 116 slaves, the poor, the agad, 116
1166611616, 116 sick, etc. The three last accompany the
imposition of hands on the catechumene (28), 66 116 faithful

the official or ordinary ordo titcrpa'coa of the Church 61

Chalcedon. After a century 61 fruitless attempta 16 bring
the dissentients once 16616 within 116 pale 61 orthodoxy, the
Imperial Government found 116611 obliged to acknowledge

not immediately make itself apparent in the sphera 61
worship, both heretics and orthodox continuing to follow the
ancient use of Alexandria. But the official Ohurch modified

1116 use little by little, under the influence of the Idturgy
61 Constantinople, until 6 11616 66166 when the latter was

completely substituted 161 it.
