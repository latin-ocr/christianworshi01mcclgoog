We must repeat again that these prayere, distributed
over the course of the day in eomewhat different faahione,
are essentially private prayere. The biehop and the clergy,
no doubt, were those who particularly observed them3 but
before the fourth century we do not ece them transferred
ιο the edifices where the public meetings cf Snnday and
the stational days were held. They are not the spiritual
exercisee of the community, that ie, of the whole Christian
community of a particular locality. In the fourth century
the fact that they were adopted by the congregatione of
aeoetice, that is, the monasteriae, attracted special attention
to them. There was no monastery that did not have ite
heure cf prayer in common. Ae in many other matters,
there were in thia respect, at first, great differentes between
the religione houeee themselves as well as between thoee
of different countries.l In the fifth century the Ilgyptian
monke had merely the two primitive honre of morning
and evening, the Gallioioioro and the Mamaeae The
monks of Syria and Mesopotamia met together, in addition
ιο these, at the three day-heure of tierce, acet, and roae
At Bethlehem, another office was added at the first honr
of day, ιο prevent the monke from retiring to bed after
the night office and eleeping during part of tha morning.
This custom spread beyond the town of ite origination,
and thus occasioned eir honre being eet apart for prayer.
A verse of Psalm cxviii,l in which the pealmiet eaye
to God that he prays to Him seven times a day, providae

a distinction between the two parta of the office of Mah'ns,
