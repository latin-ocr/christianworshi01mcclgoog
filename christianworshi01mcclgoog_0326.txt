was making its arrangements to receive them. On the
Thursday in Holy Week the obmamol Maec was celebrated,

at which the holy oils were consecrated for use in the
ceremony of initiation. They were prepared in two separate
vessels (ampellee), one of which contained nothing but pure
oil, and the other oil rendered fragrant by a mixture of
baisam. It was the Pope himself who poured the baleam
into the cil in the sacristy before tbe Mass. During tbe
ceremony the two vessels were held by clergy cf the minor
orders standing before the altar.
