which the modificatione have been most marked are as
follows :—

In the first place, the entry of the celebrante has become
an imposing ceremony. In the Byzantina Litnrgy it was
accompanied from an early date by a special chent, the
Μοικνγενής.ι Before the lectione comes the Trisagion.⁹ The
use of this doxology must be very ancient. It is common
to ull the Greek Oriental liturgias, and occure even in the
Gallican liturgy.⁰ 'l'he most ancient testimony for its
existence is found in the Counoil of Chalcedon (451)⁴

The dismissal of the catechumene, energumena, corn·
petente, and penitents, which stands out so prominently in
the liturgy of the fourth century, had all disappeared at
an early date, owing to changes in the discipline regardiug
these different categorias. The Constantinopolitan situel,

however, has preserved tc our own day the ceremony of the
dismissal of the catechumene.
But it was especially in the preparation of the elementa

of the sacred feast theta thema was found for the develop-
ment of rites and prayers. The broad and wine for conse·
oration were prepared, before the entry of the celebrante, at
a special table—the table of proposition (rpddeercl-standing
like the altar within the sacred enclosure and out of sight of
the congregation. This constituted a preparatory Mass, the
Mass of the Prothesis, which was very long and complicated.

³ In the Coptic Liturgy the 'l'risagion is placed before the Goepcl, and
after tho other lectione. In the Gallicsn Liturgy we llud it also placed
before the Gospel. and cvcn after it: but this does not interfere with ils
being sung at its normal place before tho lectione.
