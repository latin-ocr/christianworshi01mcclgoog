font The arohdeacon presented them, one by one, to the
Pope‚ who putto them the three questions, which epitomieed
the whole Oread—

Credis in Deum Patrem omnipotentem?

Orodis et iu J esum Christum, Filium ejus unicum, dominum nostrum,
natum et passum?

(tradis et in Spiritum senatum, sanctam Ecclesiam, remissionem
peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem?

After his threefold reply in the affirmative, the cun-
didate was thrice immersed, while the Pope pronormced
the formula, Baptizo tc ia concine Putris et Filii ct Spiritus
eoacti.

Baptismal immersion did not imply that the person
baptised was entirely plunged in the water. He entered
the font, in which the water would not reach beyond
the middle of an adult, and was placed under one oi
the openings from which a stream issued, or else the
water was taken from the font itself and poured over
his head. itis thus that baptism is represented on the
ancient monuments.

The actual ceremony of baptism was not performed by
the Pope alone. Prieets, deacons, and even clerice of

interior order, entered the water, clothed in long linen
tunica, and administered the sacred washing to the crowd

of neophytes.

baptismos tha women (Corui. Ap, iii. 15, 16). It must not be thought,
however, that propriety in ancient times war as easily offended aa it would
be now. The author ol De enormitate clericorum (cyprian, App, p. lae,
Hartel) does not understand that in ipso baptismate cujusquam auditas
erubescat, aar Adue et Evae renovator infautia, neo soponit sed polias occipit
