What were the influencee, we may ask, which led to the
adoption of theseydatesf Several answere have been pro·
posed, which Ι will here enumerate.

First, the Saturnalia of the Roman Oalendar were con·
sidered to have been a determining motivo. An endeavour
was made, it was thought, toturn away the faithful from
the observation of this popular festival by directing their
piety to the remembrance of Christ. This motiva must be
discarded for there is no coincidence between the two
festivals. The Saturnalia began on the 17th of December,
and were not prolonged beyond the 23rd.

Α better explanation ia that based on the festival of the
Natalia Iaoictc‘, which appears in the Pagan Calendar of
the Philocalian collection under the 25th of December. The
Invictas is the San, whose birth coincides with the winter
solstice, that is, with the 25tb of December, according to the
Roman Oalendar. The worship of Mithrae, or, speaking

more generally, of the Sun, was widespread and popular in
the third and fourth centurias. One is inclined to believe

that the Roman Choreb made choiee of the 25th of
December in order te enter into rivolry with Mithram}
This reason, however, leaves unexplained the choico of the
6th of January. sse following solution has the advantage
of explaining both festivals at the same time.

The date of the birth of Christ was fixed by taking as
a startingpoint that which was believed to be the day
of His death.

The latter date cannot be determined with historical
accuraey. The information given in the Gospels and fur·
nished by tradition is insufficient to enable us to come to a
definite solution of the question, Attempts were made,
however, at an early date to solve the problem. Clement of
Alexandria² mentions certain private calculatione which
