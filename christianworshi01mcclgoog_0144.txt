the Ohurch at which the festival was held. Iler instance, it
was not deemed necessary to say where the station was on
the days of St Marcellus, St. Agnes, St. sylvester, etc. But
for the days of Lent, for the festival of tha Holy innocente,
and for that of St. Felix of Nola, the Charch is indicated.

it does not contein. It isthe Pope's book, and contains the
prayers that the Pope had to use at those ceremonias over
which he usually presided.

Another error which we must avoid is that of regarding
the book as the work of St. Gregory himself. It certainly
contains a number of prayers which were in use in the time
of St. Gregory, aud, indeed, long before him. But the
author of the supplements added in lhance had, even in
