of the West uus inclined to look. We heve seen thet the
Bishops of Gaul end Spain were aeeustomed to proeeed
thither frequently ιο procure solutions of difficulties and
rules es οοοᾱιιοι.ι The imperial city was admirably situeted
to afford e model in the matter of worship and of liturgy.
What cannot be allowed to Lyons is reedily granted in the
cese of Milan. From the moment when Reme became no
longer the centre of attractien, irem the moment when
inspiration was sought elsewhere, Milan could not fail ιο
heve the preference over all other Churches.⁹ And it is
worthy of note thet the time ιο which we have assigned
these relations between Milan end the transalpino Ghurches
of the West oorresponds with a period in which a censider-

donensem et fldem catholicam perturbare’' (Ep. Olerirumru Italiac, Migne,
P. Lut.,rol.lxi1. p. 117).

It is ιο this equeb, und iu consequence os these relations, thet tlre dedication
of so muny Churehes in Geul under the invocatione of St Gervuis end
St Nuzuire ure te be assigned.
