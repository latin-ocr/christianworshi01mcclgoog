dipem et juetam cst, eto. In the Sacramentary of Adrion,
this form, thet is to say, the Prosocc, admits only a small
number of variatione for the chief festivals. Previcusly
these variatione were much more numerous. We would
gether from the Leonian Sacramentary thet improvisation,
or at the least the intercalation of certain sentences pre·

riously composed by the officiating priest, was still the
practice in the sixth century. ΤΙιε Preface ends withan
ascription to the glory of God, and the Sanctus.

After the Sanctus the Roman Canon, instead of proceeding
at once to the account of the Iast Supper, intercalatae s
long passage appropriated to the enumeration of the persons
in whose name the oblation is made—the whole Catholic
Charon, tha Pope (or, if occasion requires it, the bishop of
the locality), and all the orthodox bishops; then the
Sovereign and the congregation3 and finally, as represent-
ing the communiones Saints, all the righteous who have

already attained the heavenly beatitudo-the Virgin Mory,
the Apostles, and their successore the Popes, martyre, and

other saints. The oblation is thus made by the whole
Christian family, and God ia asked to accept it, and to
transform it into the Body and Blood of Christ.

The existing texts for this part of the Oanon¹ give
forins which are definitely fixed, but not so much so,
however, thet provision has not been made for additions
with tha objectos commemorating the festival of the day
or for the enumeration of certain persons or classes of
persons. Thus, there is no doubt that the names of the four
patriarche of the East, and possibly of certain Western
primates, were formerly mentioned in the Tc ipitoo· after

fratrum mentes dicendo: Saralos corde, ut, dum respondet plebs Habemus
od Dominam, admoneatur? etc. These verniolas appear already in the
Conona Hippolyti (soe Appendix).

¹ That is, the prayers which begin with the words, Tc mitur, Maean,
&emoniensem Hane fpitar, aad Quom oblationem.
