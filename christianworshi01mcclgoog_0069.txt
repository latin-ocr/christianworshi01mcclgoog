48 CHRISTIAN ivonem: ῘΤΒ ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

text was furuished by the Psalter. A less essentim but
widely used exorciso was the homily (Midrash) on a themo
supplied by the lectione.

These four elements—leotions, chants, homilias, and
prayers—were adopted without hesitation by the Christian
Churches. There was soon to be found on ιιι reader’s desk,
in addition to the books of the J ewish Bible, ιιι writings of
the Now Testament, among which a special prominenoe was
given to the Gospei. This was all the change, with the
exception, of course, of such modificatione as were neces·
sitated, by the new direction given to faith, in the text of
prayers and humilies, aa well as in the choico of the biblical
lessons and sacred canticles.

But if the Church took over aa coc all the religione
service of the synagogue, it added thereto one or two new
elementa, wnich constituted that which was original in the
Christian Liturgy. I referto the Supper, or sacred repast,
and the spiritual exercises.

These both occupied every high place in the Christian
service, such aa wa see it in the earliest documents. After
the Eucharist, certain inspired persons began to preach and
to make manifest before the assembly the presence of the
spirit which animated them. The propheta, the ecstatios, the
speakers in tongues, the interpreters, the supernatural healers,
absorbed at this time the attention of the faithful. There
was, as it were, a Liturgyof the Holy Ghost after the Liturgy
of Christ, a true liturgy with a Real Preaenoe and oom-
munion. The inspiration could be felt—it sent a thrill
through the organs of certain privileged persons, but the
whole assembly was moved, edified, and even more or less

pavished ιγ it and transported into the Divina sphera of the
aracleto.
