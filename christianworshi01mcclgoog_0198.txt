still further back, and show conclusively that the prayer
to which St. Leo added four words was already in being
in the time of Pope Damasus. The proci is to be found
ina criticism levelled at it hythe authores the maccam
Vctcris ct Noai Tcstaoccala',l who was a contemporary of
Damasus. In the mislcading theology of this writer, Mel-
chisedec is identified with the Holy Spirit‚ and, while he
is still recogniscd as the priest of God, Melchisedac's priest-
hood is considered as inferior to that of Christ: Simi-

mammas sicat castriis oblatiore praesamant have evidently
in view the form of the Roman Epiclesis, sarmatas sacerdos
toas Melchisedech.

We find, furthcrmore, in a work not much later than
the time of Damasus-tha Dc sacramentis of the pseudo-
Ambrose—large partious of the Roman Canon. Although

we cannot assign a precise date to this work, or give the
name of its author, it would seem, in my opinion, to have
been drawn up in some North Italian Charch, where the
Roman use was combined with that of Milan, probably at

Ravenna. As it assumes that the population of the towns
is still made up of pagans and Christiana, and as it is,
marcover, partly borrowad from a similar work of St.
Ambross, we cannot go far wrong in fixing its date as
somewhere about 400. The portions of the Roman Canon
which appear in it run as follows ⁹ :—
