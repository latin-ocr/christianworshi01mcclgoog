there can hardly be any doubt that it is a Gallicam
ritual we have before us.¹

A question still remains to be answerad. What is
the origin of the ceremony of the alphabeti Itis un·
known in the East3 and in the Wast, ss we have seen,
it is not attested before the ninth century, even in tha
Frankish Liturgy. From that date it is difficult to traco
it beck to its true source, and to say whether it is
Roman or Gallicam Sig. de Rossi¹ points out interesting
relations between this singular rite and certain Christian
monuments on which the alphabet appears to have a sym·
bolical signification. He hos removed all doubt as to the
idea which suggested the ceremony. It corresponds with
the taking possession of land and the laying down its
boundaries. The saltire, or St. Andrew's ewremodiensis),
upon which the bishop traces the letters of the alphabet,
recalls the two transverse lines which the Roman sur-
veyors traced in the first instance on the lands they
wished to measure. The letters written on this cross are
areminiscence of the numerical signs which were combined
with the transverse lines in order to determine the
perimeter. The series formed by these letters, moreover,
that is, the entire alphabet, is only a sort of expansior
of the mysterious contractior ΑΩ, just as the amsa, the
Greek X, is the initial of the name of Christ. The alphabet
traced on across on the peremerit of the church is thus
equivalent to the impression of a large ripam matti
on the land which is henceforward dedicated to Christian
worship.

This prosound symbolism‚ as well as the ancient custom
on which it is grafted, must go back to a time when
