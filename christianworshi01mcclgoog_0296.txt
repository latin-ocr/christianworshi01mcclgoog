the festivals of Easter and Epiphany‚ it lasted eight

days. From Jerusalem it passed to Constantinople, and
at length to Rome, where it was introduced as late as

the seventh century.¹

The Gallican Churches, ιο which thia festival was un·
known, had another ol the same significance, at least in

regard to the discovery of the true cross. They celebrated
it on the 3rd of May. It is found on this date in
several early manuscripts of the Hieronymian Martyr-
ology? In the two Gallican sacramentarios of Autun
(Musae Gothicam) and Bobbio respectively it appears
between the octave of Easter and the Rogation days,

without a more precise indication of date. In the
Gelasian Sacramentary it is noted on tho 3rd of May,

but, as it is not found in the earliest documenta bearing
on the Roman usage-the Sacramentaries of Leo and of
Pope Adrion—its presence here may be attributed ιο a
Gallican revision of this text. It seems even ιο have
been introduced into Gaul somewhat late, that is, in the
course of the seventh century, and it is possible that it
was not universelly observed there when the Roman usage
was adopted.³ The assignation of the date seems to have

sanctarum encaenia curn summo honore celebrantur, qnoniam crux Domini
inventa est ipsa die. Et ideo propter hoo ita ordinatum est, ut qnando
primum sanctae ecelesiae suprascriptae consecrabantur, ea dies essct qua
crux Domini suerat inventa, et simul omni laetitia eadem die celebrarentur.
Et hoc per Scripturas invenitur quod ea dies sit encaeniarum qua ot
sanctus Salomon consummata domo Dei quam aedificaverat, steterit ante
ultanum Dei et oraverit, sicut scriptum est in libris Paralipomenon (p. 108,

²l'or instance, those of Barna and Wolfenblittel, the latter of the
yea1772,andthe former somewhat later. In the Epternach manuscript
(Parisinus, 10837) of the beginning oi the eighth century there is no
mention ol this festival. It is also lacking in the Luxenil Lectionary,
and Gregory of Tours does not mention it either, in a passage (Gl. Mart, 5)
where we might expect to llud a notice of it.
