Ohurch in the envircns of Rome. Another dedicatory Mass
in honour of St. Stephon is found among the Messes for
the month ef Angust;¹ it must be referred either to the
Ghurch on the Via Latina, cr to that on the Cochen. The
Preface of one of these Messes, in honour cf SS. John and
Paul,2 takes for granted that the officiating priest is at
Rome and in the Ohurch dedicated to the two martyre.
The same remark is applicable to the Messes in honour
of the apostles Peter and Paul, and many others. Among
the services for the departed,8 several formularies presuppose
that those present ere at San Lorenno socri lc msere, and

that the prayers are offered for one of the Popes interred in
that Church.⁴ It is unnecessary to prees the point further.

The Roman origin of this collection is clearly evident.

On the other hand, we must hevam of regarding it
as an official book, for the use of the Pope and for solemn
statione, like the Sacramentary of Adrian. It is a private
compilation, in which various materiels of different age
and authorship have been gethered together without much
attempt at order. We find in it, indeed, the Stational

Messes for the great festivals and for the Emher days, but
beside these necessary offioes there is a vast amount of
superfluous matter. In the other Sacramentaries, the oom-
pilers have confined themselves tc giving one Mass for
each station. In the Gelasian we sometimes find two prayers
where the Gregorien gives only one (p. 141), hut one of
theseis merely a variant, or an alternative prayer. In the
