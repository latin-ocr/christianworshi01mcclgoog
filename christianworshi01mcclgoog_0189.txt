a psalm, with a melody of a special character, called the

The reason will occur to us if we consider thet in
the few Messes which have preserved the “propheta''
lection, the gradualis sung between thet lection and the
Epistle, whilst the Alleluia, or the tract, is used between
the Epistle and Gospel The two chants were et first thus
inserted respectively between the lectione, but when the
first of the latter was removed, both ohents were united
and sung between the Epistle and Gospel.

The suppression ol the prophetie lection must have
taken place at Rome in the course of the fifth century.
About the seme time it suffered similer treatment nt
Constantinople.² The Armenian liturgy, which is an
ancient form of the Byzantina, still retains the three

lectione, but in the most ancient books of the Byzantina

two.

pselms between the lectione in the Mass is as old es
these lectione themselves, and that both go beck in direct

the Christian liturgy these psalma constitute the most

ln the Gallicen uss the Alleluia was sung alter the Gospel, at the
procession oi the oblation. This is also the placa it oocupies in the
Eout. The placing of the Alleluia before the Gospel is e peculiarity of
the Romen use. Before tha timo ol St. Gregory it was sung ut Baster-
tide only (Ep. ix. 12 [26]). It would even appear thet it was originally
sung on Ecstor Dey only (Sozomon, Bia. licet, vii. 19).
