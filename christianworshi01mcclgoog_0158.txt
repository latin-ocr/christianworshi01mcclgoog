of October, but merely Messes dc siccitate umpnnls and
snper defunctos. In November we find the festivals of the
Four Chowns, of St. (lecilia, of SS. Clement and Felicitas,
Chrysogonus and Gregory, and also of St. Andrew. There
is no entry in the mouth of December until the Ohristmas
Messes, which are followed by the festivals of St. John the
Evangelist, the Holy Innocents, and the winter Ember
days

Το what date are we to assign this collection?

It contains, at the end of the month of October, a prayer
composed for the burial or funeral anniversary of Pope
Simplicius, who died in 483, but this dats would, I believe,
be far too early.

Many of the prayers, indeed, allude to the times in which
the Romans were besieged, surrounded by their enemies,
end exposed to massacre and pillege. Others express
thanksgiving to God after a victory or a deliverance.
Among the latter I would point out one which is the Secreta
of a Mass occurring in the month of July, and denoted by
the number 28. It will be seen that this Mese has no con-
nection with the month of July, but ought to be relegated
to Eastertide. This is but one ont of numberless instsnees
of the disorder which characterises the whole collection.
The Secreto is as follows :—Munera nomini too, Domine,
compactionem sellom deserimus, qai nos ab inseetis beatitate
liberatos paschale maerentum aecum tribuis mento meipsa-e.
The besieging and pillaging of Rome by Alaric, Genseric
and Ricimer, all took place in the summer months, and
therefore it cannot be to these attacks that the prayer
under consideration allodes. On the other hand, the
long siege by vitiges, which lasted a whole year, was
raised in the mouth of March. In that year (538) Easter

Sunday fell on the 4th of April. The coincidence is
noteworthy.
