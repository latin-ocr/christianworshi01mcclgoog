cantuarios. 375

Ieonian and Gregorian Sacramentaries.¹ It implies‚ like
the remainder of the formulsry‚ that several bishops are
consecrated at the same time, whilst the two addresses

quoted above are always in the singular number.⁸ Else-
where than in Rome the simultaneous consecration of

several biehops must hove been a rere occurrence. Iam
therefore inclined to believe that the formulsry is thoroughly
Roman, and that no Gallican form for this partui the
ceremony hes been preserved.

While the presiding bishop—thet is, the metropolitan—
is saying the consecrating prayer, two bishops hold over
the head of the candidate the open book of the Gospeh,
and each of the bishops present places his hand upon
him.

After the consecrating prayer came the anointing os
the hands,8 which ceremony was accompanied by the
following prayer⁴ :—

Unguentur manus istae de oleo smctihoato et chrismate sanctifica-
tionis, sicut unxit Samuel David in regem et prophetam3 ita unguentur
et consummentur in nomine Dei Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti facientes
imaginem sanctae crucis Salvatoris domini nostri teau Christi qui nos
a morte redemit et ed regna caelorum perducit. Exaudi nos, pie Pater,
omnipotens aeterne Deus, et praesta quod ta rogamus et oramus.

¹ See above, p. 361.

’ The same must be said of the Roman introductnry prayers which the
rituale mamma places before the address. The formularies after the
consecrating canon in the ordination Mass aro, on the contrary, all in
the singular number.

¹ The anointing of tho hands is the only method of unction mentioned
in tho ancient Morovingian books. That of the head is not found there:
but in the time of Louis the Pione it was the customary usage in Franco
(Arusianus, Dc Ihnl. Officiis, ii. 14).

⁴ It ie found only in tho Manna Francorum following that of the priests
(see above, p. 372), under the rubrio mmo& 1 think thatthis is not aslmplo
variant, bnt a special formulary for bishops. 'Phis distinction is conforrn-
able with present treuge, according to which the formulary colmanus ie

used for priests, and that of Uacunales for bishops.
