name of Statirae, without indicating the days; this omission
is, however, supplied by Clamant of Alexandria,l Ter·
tahan? and a number of later writers. The fasts of
the Stations were not prolonged fests, as they did not
extend beyond the ninth hour, that is, until the middle
of the efternoon.

From the point of view ol worship in its strict
sense, the services on these holy days were not all alike.
Sundsy was essentially the day for liturgioal worship in
common. The liturgical service tcclr place in the early
honrs ol the morning ; but this service was preceded by
another, held before dsybreak, which consisted of lec·
tione, homilias, the singing of chents, and the reoital oi
prayers. This nocturnal meeting, or aas, is mentioned at
an early date, namely, in the letter in'which Pliny speaks of
the customs oi the Christians.⁰ This service was com-
bined lateran with the office of Matina, which gradually
superseded it. The two services were still distinct, al-
though mentioned together, in the descriptiones the ritual
at Jerusalem given in the Peregrinatio Silviae. At Rome
the Vigil was retained for romain solemn seascns, such as
Easter, Whitsuntide, the Sundays of the Ember Dsys.
The offices for Eaeter Eve and Whitsun Eva, in that part
which precedes the benediction of the baptismal water,
still preserves the type of the ancient vigile as they
were celebrated every Sunday in the first centuries os
Christianity.⁴
