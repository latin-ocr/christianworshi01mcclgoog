great festival, then adopting the tone and style of
the most solemn prayer—the Eucharistic-he called for
the Divino blessing on that luminous piller which was
about ιο shed its radiance on the mysteries of the Christian
Passover, as in like manner of old the pillar of lire had
gone before the children of Israel ιο guido thern in their
wanderings in the desert. He dwelt poetioally upon the
elementa composing it, the papyrus,l which furnished the
wick, and the virgin oil and the beeswax, which formed
the materiai. Here occurred a ourious eulogy of the bee,
chaste and fecund like the Virgin mother, and which in
the manner of its generation furnished a type of the eternsl
origin of the Divine Worul.2

The following is the formulary now in use. I re-
pmdnce it here from the earliest manuscripts,8 without
taking into consideration later revisions.

¹ The following is the passage in the formulary Daue maadi conditor
or the Gelonion Sacramentary: “Apes vero sunt frugales in sumptibus,
in procreatione castissimae; aedificant cellulas cereo liquore fundatas,
quarum humanae peritiae ars magistra non coaequat Legunt pedibus
flores et nullum murnum in floribus invenitur. Partus non odunt, sed ore
legentes concepti foetus reddunt ommino, sicut exemplo mirabili Christus
ore paterno processit Fecunda est in his sino partu virginitas, quarn
utiquc Dominus sequi dignatus carnalem se matrem habere virginitatis
amore constituit. Talia igitur, Domine, digne seoris alteribus tuis munera
offeruntur, quibus te laetari religio christiana non ambigit.” The genarm
subject os the Praeconium Pcscbole is described, and somcwhat caueatured,
in s letter attributed to St. daroma, but certainly os the year 384 (iligna,
Pat. tac, vol. xxx. p. 182). This is addressod ιο a deacon of Placensa,
called Praesidius, who had asked the writer to draw up for him his
Prooeoas'um.

'This is the formulery which appears in the three Gallican Sacra·
mentories, from whence it passed into the supplement ιο the Sacramentary
of Adrion, which was probably oompiled by Alcuin (see above, .p. 121),
'Phia supplement acumine also the iormulsry Deus manli conditor, peculias
to the Gelasian Sacramentory. Ennodius(0paso.,9,10)has left us two
formularies ot' this kind, drawn up, doubtless, sor his own use, whilst he
was Βοοοοο ot tha Church of Pavla.
