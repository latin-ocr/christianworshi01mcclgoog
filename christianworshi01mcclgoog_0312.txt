oially those of great cities like Rome, Carthage,Alexend1-ia,
Antioch, and Nicomedia, the aocalled martyrologiee were
formed. The most ancient collectione of thie nature seem
to have been drawn up about the middle of the fourth
century, in Africa and Asia Minor respectively. They have
not come down to us in their primitive form We know
them only as they appear in the Hiemnymian Martyrology,
which was compiled about the middle of the fifth century
in Italy, and thence carried to Franco, where, about the year
595, it wae subjectcd, at Aurelio, to a revision, from which
revised tex0all existing manuscripts of it are derived In
addition to the Hieronymian Martyrology, there haa been
· preserved to ua the primitive martyrology of Asia Minor
in a much abridged Syriae translation.l

The Hieronymian Martyrology had attained, from the
seventh to the ninth century, a wideapread celebrity; but,
owing to its complexity and the many errore made by
copyiata, who were embarraeeed hy the multitude oi proper
names both of persons and places, it was held in leae eateem
than abridged texte, which, while containing fewer sainte,
furniahed certain historical details concerning them, together
with extracta from their aeta. These are what ie known aa
hiatorical martyrologiee. Th0 most ancient and beet known
exemplet are thoee oi Bede, Rabanue Maurus, Ado, and
Uauard. The latter, which was drawn up at St. Germain
des Prds about the year 875, enjoyed much popularity during
the Middle Agee. The existing Roman Martyrology ia
nothing more than a new edition of the latter, revieed and
completed by Cardiual Beroniua.
