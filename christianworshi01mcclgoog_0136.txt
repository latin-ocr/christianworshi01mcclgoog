Flavian and Diodorus, who become later on Bishops of
Antioch and 'l'arsus respectively, some pious lay people
were acciretomed ιο meet at night in the sanctuarios of
the martyre ιο pass the time in chenting psslms with two
choirs. Bishop Leontius, who favoured the Arianising party,
regarded with distrust these meetings, which were held
without his sanction. He induoed the friends of Flevian
and Diodorus to celebrate their pious vigile in the Churches
of the city. This circumstance contributed much to making
known this new method of psalmody, ond it soon spread
rapidly. By the time of St. Bosill it had already been
introduced into the Cappadociae Oaesaraa The pilgrim
Silvia, in the time of Theodosius, makes mention of noc·
turnal mcetings exactly like those of Antioch and Cesarea:
the antiphon there occupied a place alongside the ancient
responsiva psalmody: Psalmi respondeatur (sic), similiter ct
antiphatae. St. Ambrose adopted this practice in 387.ῃ Ιι
appears to have tekene longer time ιο get introduced into
the Roman Ohurch. A text, somewhat obscure in character,
it is true, of the Liber Ροοιιῄοοίἱο8 refers this introduction
to the time of Pope Celestine (422-432).

In the form in which it was adopted at Rome, the
antiphon admitted the altomative singing of a complete
psalm. All the verses were chanted to the same melody‚
bnt the melody varied for eeoh psalm. Before beginning
the psalm proper, some musical phrases were first exeouted,
to which certain words, horrowed chiefly from the psalm

itself, were adopted. This was what is called the anthem
[aetiam] It was doubtless performed as e solo by

a cantor, in order to give the tone for the following
psalmody. The psalm being ended, there was a repetition
of the anthem.
