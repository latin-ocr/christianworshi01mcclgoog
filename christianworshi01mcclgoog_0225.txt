interprete this as applying to the gates of thesoul, thetis,
the sensas, but the true signification is furniahed hythe
Liturgy of St. dames, when the deecon exclaime: Μή τις
τιῖ ν κατηχονμένων, μή τις τῶν ἀμυήτων, μή τις τῶν μή
δυναμένων ἡμῗν συνδεηθῆναιέ Ἀλλήλονς ἐπίγνωτεὲ Τὰς
fiper! Ὀρθοὶ adme! It has evidently reference to the

doora of the church, which had to be guerded in order that
no profane person might enter the assembly.

The oblation was prepared beforehand, and there was
bestowed on it νγ anticipation the same honour which it had
after consecration. It was even already designated hythe
terms Body and Blood of Christ. The preparation took place
before the entrance of the celebrant,l and was performed
with rites and prayers, of whieh no traces remain in the

Meruvingien manuscripts. Some relies of it are to be
found in the Irish books, the Stowe Miasal‚ and the Lebhar

Breac.2 The Morarahic Missal contains the whole ceremony
down to the most minute details. It even repeats it at the

¹ end of the Procession of the Oblati0n‚ after having previously

prefixed it to the entry of the celebrant. Its place after the
Procession of the Oblation is that which this rite occupies in
the Ambrosiam Missal, and it is that of its counterpart, the
Offertory, in the present Roman use. The preparation of the
oblation in this place can be regarded only es a modification
suggested by the Roman use. We may still recogniae the
latter in the ceremony of the Varobiooa' of Milan, who make
at this point the offering of breed and wine; acustom
observed also in many Ohurehes of lhance. The offer-ing νγ
the people at this point in the Mass,is a ceremony of Roman
origin, and is incompatible with that of theprooreaio oblationis,
a custorn common to the Gallicen and Oriental rite.
