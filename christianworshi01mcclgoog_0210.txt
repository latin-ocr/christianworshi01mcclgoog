CHAPTER VII.

THE eamean MARS.

meallen use having almost entirely dissppearsd, it would
he difficnlt to picture to onrsalves from experience the ancient
ceremonies of a solemn Mass in the Ohnrches of thia rite.
Fortunatsly, St. Germain of Paris († 576) has left us a
sufficiently clear account ol it, and one much more ancient
than that afforded by the Roman Ordines. I will restrict
my description of it, therefore, to that given by this venereble
author, and in reproduoing his text¹ will compare it with
other documentery sources for reconstructing the Gallican

use—that is, the Mozarabic Missal, the liturgioal books
of Merovingian Gaul, of Britain, and of North Italy. As
the Gallican texts are less known and less accessible than

the Roman, Ι have thought it necessary to introduce in
my description all the formularies for prayers and ohante
which the Gallioan Mass contained. With this purpose

in new, I have selected those for the festival of the
Nativity‚ and Ι take the text from the Messala Gothicam.

¹ ln this reprodnotion 1 restrict mysolf to the senwnoes or parts of
a watenes in which the rite is deacrshsd. As sor the symbolisal signi·
flcation ol the ritca, as they do not enter directly into my aima, 1 refer
tha rander to Martene's edition (domama rol. ις Migne, Pot. Lot,
vol. lxxii). Hera aad there Iventnrs to comet the most glaring errore
of the copyist.
