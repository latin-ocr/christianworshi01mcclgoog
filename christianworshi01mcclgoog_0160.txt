St. Gregory. Itis true that the Sacramentary contains the
name of a St. Gregory in two places3 hut even if there
be nota copyist’s error between the two names Georgica
and Gregorios—an error of frequent occurrence in the manu·
scripta-it cannot, in any case, be St. Gregory the Pope, as
the saint in question is a martyr. Besides this, the Pope of
that name decreed that the prayer· Hanc ἐρίων oblationem,
in the Canon os the Mass, should from this time forward
conclude with the words, dicsqccc castrecin tao pace disponas
alqaw ab aeramentorum coe eripi ct ia electorem tuorum
jaceas praga camerari. It is true, indeed, that the Canon of
the Mass is missing in the Verona manuscript. It must have
been at the beginning, in the part now lost. The prayer
Hauc igitar, however, occurs a certain number of times in
the remainder of the text, yet never once with the Gregorian
ending. As we do not find elsewhere any other indication
of a date posterior to that of St. Gregory, we shall not be far
wrong in attributing the old Veronese Sacramentery to the
middle or end of the sixth century.

It must be a purely Roman book, not only because of
the absence of any traces of Galliean elementa in it, or
because in the State prayers it always makes mentiones
the Roman Empire with peculiar loyalty, but because it
exhibita on every page those topographical touches which
enable us to distinguish between a text drawn up sor the
Ohurch of Rome locally, and one which is merely in con-
formity with the Roman use. The rubrica which announce
the festivals of the saints often designate the place os the
station with marked topographical precision. Thus we have
