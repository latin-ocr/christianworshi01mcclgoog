Five short prayers follow in the manuscript. The first
was aeid at the moment of the haetion; the second, over the
people, upon whom there was an imposition of hands
[blessing] efter the communiones the clergy; the third
was the thanksgiving after the communion of the people
lhen follows a blessing of the offered cil end water which
were to be used in private as phylacteries, and lastly thc
blessing of the assembly at the moment of dismissal.

As to the formularies which terminate the Eucholoyioa
(19-30),and which, according to the rubrio, preceded the
prayer of Oblation, the series begins (19) by a “first prayer
for Sunday,” which is, in fact, an introductory prayer.
Supplication is there made to God for the right appre-

hension of the Holy Scripturas, and for their right interpre-
tation. The second (20) eomes after the homily. Ι take

it that these two prayers presuppoee the presence of those
who are still outside the pale of Christianity, though they
may be disposed ιο embrace it, or, at least, to be instructed
in it. The three ensuing formularies are prayers for the
catechumene (21), for the siclr (22), and for the fruita

of the earth (23). The prayer for the catechumena was
doubtless used at the moment cf their dismissal. Thon

follows a prayer for the local Church as a whole (24),
then another for its sancus membern, bishops, priests,

deeccns, subdeacons, lectore, interpretare,1 aecrtcc (μονά-
Ζοντες), virgins, and married people, Next we have (26)
a “prayer of genuflection‚'' which deals with the names

inscribed in the book of life. Perhaps this had some con·
nection with the recitation of the diptycha. The prayer

¹ lu ligypt the Greek had to bc translated into Captis.
