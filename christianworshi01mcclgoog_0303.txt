a festival in commemoration ol a miracle which was
performed on the tomb ol the apostle at Ephesus. This
miracle was known in Gaul, for Gregory ol Tours makes
mention of it.¹ In the Missele Gothicam thereis a Mass
S. ‚Iohannis Apostoli et Evangelistac between the festival
of the Invention of the Crosa (May 3) and the Rogation
days. The connection is closer, I think, between this
festival and that observed in the Greek church than
between it and the Roman Commemoration. But there
ie nothing to prevent our believing that the latter, which
must have been instituted when Rome was under Byzantina
influence, had been itself determined by some consideration
os the solemnity at Ephesus.2

The festival of the let of May in honour ol SS. Philip
and James was also an anniversary of the dedication of
achurch, namely, os that called the Holy Apostles at
Rome. This church‚ originally founded by Pope Julius
<eat-352), was rebuilt about 561 hythe Popes Pelagius Ι.
and John 111, and placed under the names ol the two
apostles Philip and dames. The lst of May was fixed
upon for the day ol the dedication, because the festival
of St. Philip was commemorated on this date.a Ι am
unable to single out from the two or three apostles so
named, the James who was here associated with St. Philip.
The Hieronymian Martyrology mentions the festival of
St. Philip at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and an interpolation
occurs here of the name of st. dames, who is thus placed
undere false topographical rubrio. The Gallicam liturgical
books contain no mentiones any festival commemorating
either St. Philip alone cr associated with St. dames.

ol the cauldron ol boiling oil, in which, according to a tradition already
in existence in the second century, St. John was said to hare been plunged
(Tertullian, Praese, 36).
