7. wa raritas of tlte Apostles.

1 have already mentioned certain festivals of the
apostles celebrated at Christmastide. Ι prooeed now
to deal with some other festivals of the same nature,
confining myself to the notice of those which were
celebrated at an early date in the West. The most
important os these is that of St. Peter and St. Paul, on

the 29th of June. It appears in the Philoealian calendar
of the year 336, coupled with the consular date 258.
I heve elsewhere¹ shown how this date may serve to
determine the origin of the festival. We have here, not J

the anniversary of the martyrdom of either of the apostles‚
or of them both together, but merely the commemoration
of the translation of their relies to the place called
ad Catoremtaa, at the third mileatone on the Appian
Way. At the beginning of the fourth century, when the
calendar cf the Roman Church was drawn up, sr01n which
calendar the text of the Philocalian is derived, the bodies
ol the two apoatles were still reposing in this place.
They were removed from it later on to be deposited in
the basilicas raised to their honour by the Emperor Con-
stantine on their original buryingplaces at the Vatican
and the Ostian Way respectively. These translations brought
about no change in tha date of the celebration of their

festival, the observation which had doubtlese become rooted
in the customs of the Christian population in Rome.

The same calendar contains, undar the date of the 22nd
of February, a festival entitled Notata Patri dc cathedra.
It was intended to be a commemoration of the beginning
of the episcopata or apostolate of St. Peter. Its oon·
nection with the festival of the 29th of June waa exactly
the same as that which existe between the anniversarias
