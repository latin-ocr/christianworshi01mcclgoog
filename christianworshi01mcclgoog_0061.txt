Milan ιο Rome. The correspondence between Rome and
Arles became incessant, and the Biehops of Seuthem Gaul
grew accustomed to proceed to Rome ιο submit their
disputes to the tribunal of the Pope. We note the presence
of such bishops at the Roman councils of the fifth centmy.
If the Weetern Empire had been able to maintain its
existence, an ecclesiastice] centralisation similar to that
which had made such vigorous progress in the East, would
have been established at an early date in the West. St.
Leo had placed this ecelesiastical concontration under
legal protectior by obtaining from Valentinian 111. a
recognitiones his right ιο compel the bishops of all the
provinces to appear before his tribunal.¹ This western
centralising movement was, however, thwarted by the
rise of the barbarian kingdoms. Politice] fronticis were
established between Rome and the Churches which lay
beyond the Alps and the seas. The laws and function-
aries of Ravenna hed no longer any influence in Vandal
Africa, in Frankish Gaul, and in Visigothio Spain.
Whether Catholic or heretic, the barbarian kings regarded
with but slight favour the maintenance of regular and
frequent communicatione between their bishops and the
Bishop of Rome, a subject of that power at the expense
of which their own authority had been established On
the other hand, the Frankish and Visigothic sovereigns
soon recognised the necessity of being on good terme
with their bishops. The Roman Imperial officials having
once disappeared, the bishops were found to be the best
qualified representatives of the conquered population, and
numberless occasions arose for an appeal to their moral
authority. Constant relations were thus established between
the various Churches and the sovereign, and the Court of the
king became the centre of ecclesiastical as of all other affairs.
