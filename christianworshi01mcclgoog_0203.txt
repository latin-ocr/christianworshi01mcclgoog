This symbolical transferencc is in a contrary sense to that
implied in the Greek formulary3 it involves not the descent
of the Holy spirit upon the oblation, but the elevation by
God's angel of the oblation to heaven. But in both cases
alike it ie alter it has been brought near to, and has

kinds-wheat, wine, cil, etc. This view is confirmed,

a tablet, or something oi this kind.
