This festival was peculiar to Rome, and was never
imported into the Eest,¹ or into the countriss of the Gallican
rito. Itis certain that it was intended to commemorate
the dedication oi the basilica on the Esquiline. This dedi·
cation, therefore, bed taken place on the let of August. As
the let of August, from the time of Augustus, was a day oi
pagan religione observance and rejoicing‚⁹ it is possible that
it was designedly chosen

The special festival of St. Paul (January 25) vas ol
much less importunae than those just mentioned. In the
Aureus recension oi the Hieronymian Martyrology it is
called Tracelotio S. Palas· Apostoli, without any indica-
tion as to where this translation had taken place. ln the
Miseale Gothicam there is a mass la carralem S. Pacli,
which appears to have been assigned to the same data.8
In the ancient Roman books there ia absolutely no mention '
of this festivaL⁴

The festival of St. John the Evangelist (May 6) must
bave been the anniversary of the dedication of tbe ohuroh
near the Porta Latina, which hed been consecrated in his
honour. This ohuroh is mentioned for the first time iu
the liber Poatlfieole'a, in the passage dealing with Pope
Adrion Ι. (772-795).5 Ήιθ festival of st. John cate
Portam Latiarem bas no earlier testimony than the Sacra-
mentary of the same Pope. We ought, however, to take note
of the fact that the Greeks celebrate on the 8th of May⁸

¹ In tho Faat there aro festivals in honour of tho chains ol St. Peter,
or of the deliveranco ot St. Peter (Acts xii), but they bave no connection
with the Roman festival under oonsidoration.

² The vulgar still observa at Rome tha day of the felice Aposto.

⁴ We must bear in mind, however, that tho Roman mass lor sexagesima
Sunday is really a mass in honour ol et. Paul Tho station was held ou
that day in tho basilica of this apostlo on the Ostian Way. 'lbera aro

not amcludo lrom this that tho festival existed in his time.
