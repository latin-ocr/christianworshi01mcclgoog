It was not only, however, into the eities of recent
foundation that Jewish colonies were introduced3 we find
them, and that at an early date, in the Greek citios of the
AEgean. There again they played a part amongst the

the Macedonian dynasties. Into the midst of this restless
population, sthred periodieally by the remembrance of their
