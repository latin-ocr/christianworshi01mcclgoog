When the chent was ended, the Lord's Preyer,¹ with, es
in all the liturgias, e short prefece at the beginning end an
elaboration of the hibero nor a meio et the end, was then
said. Ι append the textos the letter from the Missala
Gothicam for Christmas Day-

Non nostro praesumentes, Peter sancte, merito, sed domini nostri
J esu Christi Filii tui obedientes imperio, sudemus dicere:

Pater noster, etc.

Libere nos, omnipotens Deus, sb omni melo, sb omni periculo, et
custodi noe inomni opere bono, perfecta veritas et vere libertas, Deus,
qni regnes in saeeuh saeculorum.

The Pater nostor was said, not only by the priest, but
also hythe congregation.² At present the participetion of
the congregation is confined, in the Mozerebic rite, to the
reeiting oi Amen to each oi the petitione in the Pater
rwster.

Thon came the rite oi the Oommixtio. The celebrent

dipped one or more of the consecrated partiales into the
chalice. In the Monerabie rite ei the present day it is

the particle regnum which is used for thie purpose. The
celebrant holds it over the chalice and says thriee-

Vicit leo de tribu J uda, radix David, alleluiu

To which is said the response—

Qui sedes super Cherubim, radix David, alleluia.

eim: “Harum ultima est oratio qua Dominus noster discipulos suos orere
institnit,'' etc. In Spain it was customary to reciie the Niceno Creed
before the Pater mater. This eornm was instituted by a deerce oi no
third Council oi Toledo (589), c. 2 (ef. Isidoro, op. rit, e. 16).
