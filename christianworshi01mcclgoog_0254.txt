Saturday. Tha ancient formularies of indiction, however,
which are given in the homilias of St. Iac, mention the fast

of the Wedneadays and Fridays only. That of the Saturday
being merelya “superposition‚” or prolongation of that of

the Friday,is not taken into account.¹ The distingniahing
feature of the Satnrday was the Solemn Vigil, which on thie
day was always observed at St. Peter's: thrtc opiter at secta
scria jaccetanum sabbato actam ad beatam Petram apostoleca
parim mpdamcs. The Vigil was always followed by the
Mass in the early hours of the Sunday.

The Emberday fests, which are met with in those
countries only which followed the Roman use, and which
ewen in Rome did not take their risa till the fifth century,
appear to me to be none other than the weekly fast, as
observed at the beginning, but made speciclly severe, as well
by the retention of the Wednesday, which had disappeared
early from the weekly Roman use, as hythe substitution of
a real fast⁹ for the semi-fast of the ordinary Stations.
The choica of the weelrs in which the fast was thus in-
creased in rigour was determined by the commencement
of the four seasons of the year. Itis probable that from
the first institution of the Ember Days the Synaxes of the
Wednesdays and Phidays, or at all events those of the
Wednesdays‚ were liturgical. This appears to me to be
suggested by the archaia arrangement of the Mass for the
Wednesday in Ember Week, in which the prophetie lection
was still preserved, although it had fallen into disum in
most Messes in the course of the fifth centrny.

¹ 'l'ho author of tho later Pontificalla (vol ‘a p. 141), on tho contrary,
mentions thie one only. The rewn iethet he is dealing with it aa a
matter of practico, and not lilre St. Leo, aa a matter of tradition. The
Satnrday fast wae the most severe, as no foed could have been eatan alnae
the Thursday night.

² There was a much greater difference in the atrictnesa with which the
fast was obaerved than in the methodo of dxing the tasting days themselves.
