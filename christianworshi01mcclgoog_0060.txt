Ravenna. They appointed as his successor Patroclus, who
was in great favour with Constantius, but who was an
ambitious,int1iguing,and avaricious man, and at the same
time elever and audacious. Pope Zosimus, who had been
prepossessed beforehand in favour 01 this individual and
had been deceived as 10 his moral character, hasteued‚ on
sueceeding 10 the pontificato, to grant him letters which
invested him with powers superior to all the bishops 01 tha

and did 001 even result in secming precedence for tha
Bishops 01 Arles in the councils of the Frankish Empire.

But 11 the vicariate never became an effective institu-
