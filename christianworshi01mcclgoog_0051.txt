Ihave already spoken of ecclesiastical centralisation in
Africa. There, the primacy of Carthago did not prevent a
certain provincial grouping of the episcopata around the
senior bishop of each province. In the African coancils, of
which we have so large a number, it is always necessary to
distinguish between those that are provincial only and those
that are general, convoked and presided over by the Bishop
