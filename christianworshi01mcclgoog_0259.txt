and fifth centurias, owing to the differenoes between the
Alexandrian and Roman computatione. These difficulties
arose from certain differenoes in calculation and custom.

calculated at Rome, was founded on imperfect lunar oyoles.

Alexandria Eaater might be kept on the l5th. Finally, a
tradition was supposed to exist at Rome aooording to
which Easter could not be observed after the alst of April.
