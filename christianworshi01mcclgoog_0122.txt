us date back to tha last period of tha Merovingian
rule. Nearly all of them contain formularies of Roman
origin and Messes in commemoration of Roman saints,
As early as the time of Gregory of Tours, tha Hierony·
mian Martyrolopy, a book of Roman origin, though not
oi an official nature, was introduced into Gaul and adopted
to the Usa of the country. The Sacramentery of St. Denis,
known as the Gelestae Sacranaentary-a work which ia,
in fact, fundamentelly Roman-was drawn up at the
latest in the time of Charles Martel. Some other books,
or fragments of books, of both Roman and mixed origin,
belong to this period, that is to say, to a time when the
influence of St. Bonifaca had not yet made itself felt in
the Frankish Ohurch, at all events, within the limits of
ancient Gaul.

That St. Bonifaca gave a strong impulsa to liturgical
reform aud to the adoption of Roman customs is indu-
bitable. We know little, however, of tha details of his
activity in this direction. He must have been vigorously
supported by the Popes, whose counseHor he was, as well
as their legata. There was introduced into the matter,
moreover‚ azoal and an acrimonious heat far removed
from tha spirit manifested in the Gregorian document Ι
have just cited. One of the moat impressive n'tes in tha
Gallicam Mass was the benediction of the people hy
the bishop at the moment of communion. So much
importance was attached to this rita that it was retained
even after tha adoption of the Roman Liturgy. Almost
all tha Sacramentaries oi tha Middla Ages contain formu·
laries of benediction3 they are even still in use in tha ¹
Church of Lyona. l quote here a letter to Bonifaca from

{pope Zacharias, which shows how the latter speaks of
