in the ancient Sacrameutnry of Gellona (eighth to nintb
century), where it is accompanied by the explanation Sacasa-
dant Gallos, As far as Rome was concemsd, the festival of
tha 22nd of February was maintained to the exclusion of the
other, and that, too, down to tha sixteenth century.¹

A third festival of St. Peter was celebrated at Rome on
the lst of August This was the festival of the Dedication cf
the Ghurch of the Apostles,n on the Esquiline, which was re·
built in the time of Xystus [Sixtus] 111. (432-440) at the
eost of the Imperial family of the East. In this church ware
preserved, as much-venerated relies, the chains of St. Peter,
by which name the basilica itself was frequently designanda

¹ Dc Rossi, aaa, 1867, p. 38. 'l'ho conclusione arrived at in this
learned memoir differ from :those which I put sorward hore. This differ·
once must not be attributed to sn insufficicnt or superficial examination cn
my part of the reasons alleged and of the solutions set asida. I arn unable
to admit, iu particular, that there was any connection, before the later
hiiddlc Ages, between the Natolc (lethericus S. Petri and the cult of the
relic venerated at Rome under the namo cf Ohair of St. Peter. The texts
adduced to prove that this ehair was in existence as carly os the fourth
century in thc baptistcry of tho Vatican haro nottho meaning assigned
to them. They speak of the aas Petri, or Sedet Apostols’ea, only in a
metaphorioal sense. The statement of Ennodius as to o aeta panaria,
hae reference to the solbs cn which the consuls used to be carried on the
day of thc consular pnroessiou (Rasna de Pbr'lolcpic, vol. vii. (1883), p. 81).
The most ancient mention of this relic, indeed, occurs in tha catalogue of
Mouza, belonging to the time of St. Gregory and Quaen Theodelinda (De
Roesi, Roma Sos.,v01. i. p. 176): oreo dc sals ati prins sedit coaetus Petras.
'l'his oil had been obtained far from thc Vatican, that is, on the Via Salaria
or Via Nomentana. 'l'he sanctuary from which it came contained a Sales
St. Petri, which may hare been taken at a later date to the Vatican. It
seems not to have been in much repnte until thc tenth century at earliest.
Thero is not tho slightest allusion to it in the writings of St. Gregory, or
in tho topographieal descriptione of ltome cf the seventh or eighth century,
or iu the Liber Pontificols’s.

² Philip, apricat of this churrh, was sent as alegate to the Council
of Ephesus (431),and signorl its doerces (Herdonia, vol. i. p. 1483). It
existed, therefore, before Xystus 111.

’This designation, a rimulis Β. Petri, is met with for the first time
in the faber Post, rol. i. p. 261, in the account of an crant of tho year
501, and later on, in an inscription of tar (cua, p. 285). As to the chains
of st. Peter, sce the poemof Areten read in this basilica in 544.
