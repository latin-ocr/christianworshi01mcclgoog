determining the organisation of ecelesiastioal govemment,
and the form of publio worship.

The Christian Ohnrehes appear before us in the earliest
documents as having over them a hierarehy of two or three
grades. The lowest gradeio that of the ministare, or sarving
brothton, to whom were entrustod temporal matters, and who
exercised the lower functione of divine worship. These were
thedeaoons. Abovethem were the“elders,”presbyteri,priests,

or the “inspectura” episcopi, bishops. It is clear that in

but either of all Christian bodies generally, or of those of
particular regions. As these great leaders gradually passed
away, a definitive hierarehy made its appearance. In eaoh
town, all tho Ohrhtiaus and all their directore, presbyteri,

ol bishop was shortly after exclusively applied. Around
him, aud constituting with him a college, were his priest-
eounaellors3 boneath them the deaoons, who in their fune-

after assistod by a whole staff of inferior ministare.

The question has been raised how far all this organisation
grew out of that of tho Jewish communities. It appears to
me tohave hadita origin above all in the nature of things.
Itis indeed diffioult to imagine a eommunity of the sort
that we are dealing with, without aeouneil‚a staff of working
functionaries, and a head ableto aet and direct¹ This was
