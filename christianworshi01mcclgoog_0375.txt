This is the formulary cf the Gelasian Sacramentary
(i. 20); the other two do not contain it. The Ordo IX.
and that of St. Amaud have formularies almost identical.
According to the rubric of the Gelasium Sacramentary, it
is the Pope who delivere the address: adnunciat pontisce
ira popolo, dicens. One cf the Ordines assigna this duty
tc a lector, while the other refers it tc sacristariae, or
notary. These two terma must be considered as meaning
the seme thing, for in the first case the word lector does
not designate a cleric ot that order, but the person who is
performing the function at the moment. We may conclude,
moreover, that, although the formulary is given iu the
Gelaeian Ordo es pronounced by the Pope and drawn up
in his name, it was always read by some one acting ou
his behalf.

The candidates for ordination were stationed at a certain

place where they could be well seen and their identity
well established. This public probation had beau preceded
by a declaration, made before the highest dignitaries cf
the Ohurch, in which the candidate had to swear that he
had never committed any ot the four heincus sins, the
commission cf which, according tc the discipline cf the
time,¹ was an impediment to the reception ol orders.

¹ 'Phene sins are enumeratcd in the Ordo VIII. of Mabillou; they
were: aodomy, bestislity, adultery, violation oi consecrated virgins 'Ibis
enumeration does not include all the sins, whether secret or open, which
in the ancient discipline were subject to public penanoe, and constituted
thus a bar tc orders. There is, therefore, e difficulty here which, aa lar
aa 1 cnr awere, has never been satisfactorily solved. 1 consider, tor my
pert, that these interrogatories prelimiunry to ordination go back tc a
time when baptism was received at adult age, and that it had not in view
the present mndition of the conscience of the candidate, bnt his conduct
msere haring received baptism. While pruclsirntng the remissior ot sins,
however heincus they might bc, by virtue oi the scemment or baptism
