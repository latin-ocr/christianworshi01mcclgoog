ψωτιζόμενοι, took place universally during lent} On a
given day the candidates were solemnly taught the symbol
ef the Christian saith, and at Rome this tradition of the
symbol was accompanied by the tradition of the Gospel
and the Lord's Prayer.

Immediately before their baptism (except in Spain,
and perhaps in Gaul) the candidates received the pre-
paratory anointing with the signing of the crass upon
the organa of sense, parficularly on the ears and mouth.
At Rome the signing of the organa of sense is made with
saliva, whereas in the East, and in the countries observing
the Galliean use, the same oil is employed with which
the body is αηοίιιυθά.2 In all Latin countries this ceremony
precedes the renunciation of the devil; in all others it
immediately follows it.

The threefold renunciation of Satan, or the abjuration

of paganism‚is also common to all the ritca. Everywhare‚
except in Gallican countries, it is followed by the recitation

of the breed? in which the candidate expresses his adherenoe
t0 his new Master, J esus Christ.

The last profession of faith, under the form of a reply
to a triple interrogation, is of universal use. so is also
the triple immersion, except in Spain, where immersion
took place only once. Α special peculiarity is found in

Gaul and North Italy [andin Ireland-Ta] in tha washing
of the feet after baptism.

derived its origin. Sea capra, p. 242.

took place, as at Rome, before the Ecstor vigil, after the last axoreism,
Perhaps saliva was used, but at any rate no mention is made of the nse
of oil. This is to be gethered from aa ancient Egyptian rituales which a
German version has been published, together with the Carraria es Hippolytae,
by Hcrr Η. Achelia in Teate arrd Uraterroclrcupen‚ vel vi. p. 93.

'In the Ferat there are two “redditione” of tha Oreed (seo p. 829):
one before the day ef the renunciatien‚ tho other immediately after that
ceremony. 'llic Galliean rite has retained the first of these only.
