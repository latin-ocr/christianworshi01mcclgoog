In dealing with the Eastern ceremonias, Ι will confine
my descriptione to those furnished by the Apostolic
Ocrcstitotc'oas (viii, 4 ct sep), and by the Dc Ecclesiastico
Hicrorchio cf Dionysius the Areopagite (c. 5).¹

If the ordination is that of a bishop, the candidate
is presented to the congregation, at which several bishops,
snrmunded by the local clergy‚ preside The principat

bishop-thet is, by right, the metropolitan or his suistitute
-interrogates the congregation as to the identity of the
candidate and his qualifications. Is he the man of their
choicel Has he such and such a qualification for his
position? These questions are thriee repeated, and at the
third time with additional solemnity. The people were er·
posted to reply in a lond voice, “ Hc iswcrthy! Ἄξιός zara?

‘lhen three os the bishops approach the altar. The
candidate kneels down, and while two deacons hold the
open book of the Gospels on his head, the presiding
bishop recites a consecrating prayer, eucharistie in form,
at the andos which comes the response, dcccco.

The newly made bishop is then conducted to his scat,
receives the kias of peace, and then celebrates the Mass

The same form is observed in the case of priests,
deacons, deaconesses, subdeacons, and readers, with tha
exception that the diocesan hishop alone presides at the
ceremony. Tha consecrating prayers arc always accom-
panied by the imposition of hands.

Such is the ritual of the Apostolic Ooasta'tutc'cms.² The

’After tha rcciting ol the consecrating canon over the hinhop, tha
author ot the Ap. douc. adds: ⁴⁸ Eis τᾶν ἐπισκόπων διαφερέτω τὴν cmlv Η

τῶν χειρῦν τοῦ χειροτονηθέπος.” These worda have no clear meaning to roe.
