Tim different forms taken by the ascetic life in Christian
antiqnity succeeded one aiter another in the following
sequence.¹ In the earliest times individual asceticism was
practised without its involving separation from the ecclesi·
astical community and family life, or absence from the city
and ordinary avocatione Experianco having subsequently
shown the difficulty of reconciliug such conflicting duties,

ascades “retircd from the world‚” and sought silence and
solitudo away from human habitatione. This second stage
is that of morlo, or isolated auctoritas. Finally, these
ascetics or anchoritosconceivcd the idea of living together,
of forming groups of individuale drawn exclusivaly from
persons of their own calling, isolated from the “world’'
anderen from ordinary Christiam It was thus that the
coenobitis life took its origin.

It is merely with the first stage that I hove to deal here,
namely, that of the ascetics attached to the local ahurclu
without segregation of any kind Their ranks were recruited
from both sexes, even at an early period3 we noto their
presence even in the second century under various names,
such as arcator, eunucha, continentes, mutuae, etc. lha
