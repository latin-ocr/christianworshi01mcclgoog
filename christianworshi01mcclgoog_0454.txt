Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, iteratis precibus
te supplices exoramus, pro quibua apud te supplicator eet christus,
conjunctiones famulorum tuorum fovere digneris benedictiones tuas
excipere mereantur, et filiorum successibus fecundentur. Nuptias eornm
sicuti primi hominis confirmare dignam avertantur ab ais inimici omnes
insidiae, ut sanctitatem Petrum etism in ipso conjugio imitentur, qni
providentia tua, Domine, conjungi meruenmt.

It is interesting to note that the nuptial ritnal deÎ‡
scribed by Pope Nicolasis neither more nor less than
the ancient Roman marriage rite, without the sacrifice,
or rather with the substitution of the Mass for the
pagan sacrifice The Romans themselves distinguished
between the preliminary engagement or betrothal aud
the nuptial ceremony proper. Their rite began by the
mutual engagement, which was contracted by both parties
in presence of each other in a set form of words. This
engagement was marked by the delivery of the ring, or
adonicam then followed the drawing up of the marriage
contract, accompanied by gifte from the bridegroom to
the bride All this took place in the presence of the
friends of the family, who were afterwards entertained
at a banquet.

On the morning of the marriage the gods were at first
consulted by the taking oi auspices. At a ister date the
divination of the haruspex, which presupposed a sacrifice,
was substituted for the auspices. On the previous evening
the woman had laid aeide her maideu dress and had assumed
the garments of a bride. Her head was covered with the
domomum, or red-coloured veil, which, with the exception
of the colour, was the same as that wem by all married
women. It is from this obstante capitis that the terme
cohme, nuptiae, negotiola, are derived The bride's hair was
divided into sir plaits, aud her head crowned with flowers
which she herself had gethered. A similer floral crown
was also worn by the bridegroom.
