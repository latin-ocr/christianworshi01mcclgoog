and resembling those prescribed by the Theodosian Oode for
certain classes of functionaries. The Roman Ohureh, for one

reason or another, refused to accept them, or rather eonfined
itselfto the adoptiones the pepalpulls'um, which soon acquirsd

ardistinetly special significares. Elsewhere, this vestment
was adopted ior the three superior orders of the hierarchy,
introducing slight differencss according to the ecclesiastical
rank to which the wearcr belonged. 'l'he deacon wore it
over one shoulder‚ the priest and bishop around the neck;
the desem over the tunicle, which was his upper germont,
the priest under the planeta, the bishop above it.l

The pellium, with the exceptiones the crosses which
ornamented its extremities‚ was always white in colour,
as was also the stole of the deaeon and that of the priest
or bishop. The pellionibus universally and from all time

been made of wool. In the East the diaeonal stole was of

linen, but Ι am unable to say of what material either it or
that of the priest was composed in the countries of the west*

¹Wc have, however, vory little information ua to this nretbod oi
differentiating priest and bishop. The Cenon ol tho third Coundl
ol Braga (sec sama, p. 391), dccreeing that priests should oron the
orarium over the broast‚ presupposcs thercby tbat it was worn under tha
plancta The council does not say that this mctbod ol wearing it was to
be peculiar to priests only, and that bishops should follow some other
fashion. The term sacerdotes, which it employa, may include bisbops ss
well as priests. Beyond this, we can glean no information nem the
ancient ecclesiasticcl literature ol Spain In Gaul, St. Germia of Paris
speaks of tbe episcopal pellium after having described the chasuble, which
might lead us to believe thet the palliam was worn above it 1 have
already mentioned that Bishop Ecclesins of Ravenna is represented with
the stole, armarium, hanging down in sraut, undar the planeta, while at
the same time he wears the pellium over it, and that this oustcnr was
adopted in Franco in the Carlovingian period 'l'hs Greek bishops also
wear simultancously the epitraobslica and the omophorium. This accurun-
lation of insignia was forbidden in Spain in the sevanth century (Gens.
Tot, iv. e. 39), and we note that the Pope abstained from wearing both vest·
ments till about the twelsth century, ,having previously used tbe pansa
only, without tha stole.
