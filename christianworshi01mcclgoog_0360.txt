of that sect, and who then leaves it to enter the catholic
Ohureh, should be treated as a pagan, that ie, as one not
initiated. He must be baptiscd, since the baptism he has
already received is not valid. “

Tertullien's view was that of the African Ohmch, end
in particular that of the Metropolitan Ohurch of Carthaga.
The same practice was observed by the Ohurchse of Syria
and of Asia Minor. This was not the case, however, at
Rome and Alexandria In these two great Ohnrohes, and
in those following their direction, a distinction was made.
Baptism with water was admitted to be valid, whoever
had administered it and in whatever sect it had been oan-
lamed, so long as the essential forms had been observed
As to the remaining part of the initiation, it was rejected,
and had therefore to be repeated in the case of the heretic
who demanded entrance into the Ohurch.

In the year 256, the divergence between the African and
Roman practice was the cause of an animated discussion
between Pope Stephon and st. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage ;
but the conflicting customs‚ notwithstanding, remained un·
modified It was not until the Council of Arles, in 314,
that the Catholic Ohurch in Africa gave up her ancient
practice.¹ It was, nevertheless, obstinetely persisted in by
the Donatista, who even applied it to the Catholic Ghuroh,
which was treated by them as a dissentient sect. The
Eastern Churoh also continued to regard the baptism of
heretice as invalid.² Distinctions, however, econ came to
be introduced. We find the Conncil of N icaea decreeing the
adoption of a different treatment towards the Novatians
and the partisans of Paul of Samosata.⁸ The seventh canon
